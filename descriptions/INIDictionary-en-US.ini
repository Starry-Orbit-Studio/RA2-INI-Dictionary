DamageFireTypes="""
  Specifies a list of animations that can be (in random order) displayed as "fires" springing up on damaged buildings.

  ## Notes

  Animations here are created when the building's health drops below `[AudioVisual]`→[ConditionYellow=percent](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConditionYellow), with random initial frame.

  - For [CanBeOccupied=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CanBeOccupied) structures, DamageFireTypes are created when the building's health drops below `[AudioVisual]`→[ConditionRed=percent](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConditionRed) only.
  - If the building is repaired and restored to a healthy state before the animation playback completes, these animations will be immediately removed.
  Only removal occurs, not immediate termination, therefore [Next](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Next) and other flag behaviors will not be executed.

  ## Notes

  When a debris with [IsMeteor=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsMeteor) falls on the water surface, besides playing the splash animation, it will also use the animation set here.

  When ships are [shaken by squids](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Organic#Notes) and when units are in the process of [sinking](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShipSinkingWeight#Notes), animations here are continuously created as well.

  Units with [Underwater=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Underwater) will not create the animation here.

  Besides locomotors that are not on the ground, [Walk](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Walk), [Mech](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Mech), and [Teleport](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Teleport)[1] also cannot use this effect.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Locomotor=Teleport originally does not have a moving process

  ## Notes

  This is simply created when units using the [DropPod](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#DropPod) locomotive touch the ground and this temporary locomotive is removed. Correspondingly, in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), warheads that have [IsLocomotor=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsLocomotor) can also trigger the animations here, although due to the incompleteness of the relevant logic, the behavior of those units after touching the ground is not normal.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This list has to contain two items. The first animation is used as the west facing version, and the second one as the east facing version. It is most likely that adding more entries to this list will cause [Internal Errors](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error).

  In [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm), the list has to contain four items. In the original game, the latter two are just copies of the first two.

DeadBodies
MetallicDebris="""
  Specifies a list of animations that are used as possible debris when an object is destroyed which specifies a number of debris, but doesn't define the precise debris to use. Also used (in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) only) when a warhead specifies a number of debris to spawn with each impact, since warhead-level debris control is not implemented.

  ## Notes

  When an object does not specify a series of Voxel debris via [DebrisTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DebrisTypes), the program will retrieve the Shape debris to be created from the [DebrisAnims](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DebrisAnims) list, which serves as the default value for DebrisAnims.

  Since Westwood in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) extended flags like [MaxDebris](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MaxDebris) to the [Warheads](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warheads) but omitted DebrisAnims, this results in Shape debris creation via Warhead being controllable only by that global flag.

  ## In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) and [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm)

  For every `nth` factory, the production speed is calculated with the following formula, provided that `n > 1`:

  Build speed = 100% * MultipleFactory * (n-1)
  Due to the nature of this formula, the production speed bonus behaves rather irrationally. See the following examples:

  - If `0.5 < MultipleFactory < 1.0`, building a second factory slows down the production speed, while building more than two factories increases it. If `0.33... < MultipleFactory < 0.5`, you need more than three factories to increase the production speed. And so on.
  - If `MultipleFactory=1.0`, building a second factory gives no bonus at all, but getting a third factory doubles the production speed.

  ## In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge)

  Contrary to previous C&C games, MultipleFactory is now a linear, cumulative multiplier to factory production speed, with lower values meaning faster speed.

  - For example, when `MultipleFactory=0.8` you get a build rate of `1.0` for having one factory, `1 * 0.8 = 0.8` for having two, `1 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64` for having three, `1 * 0.8^3 = 0.512` for having four, etc.

TunnelSpeed="""
  This flag determines how fast [vehicles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes) with the subterranean [locomotor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) will travel vertically by acting as a multiplier for the vehicles' own [speed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed#On_Unit_Types) value, i.e. when submerging to or emerging from the ground. Together with the unit's [ROT](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROT) setting, it also affects how fast the unit rotates as it begins to burrow. Higher values indicate faster speed.

VeteranRatio="""
  This flag determines how many times the own value in credits a unit must destroy more than in order to be promoted. It is based on the [Cost](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost)= values of objects and a straight multiplier.
  Note that this isn't limited to enemy objects. Civilian/Neutral, as well as your very own objects when [Temporal](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Temporal)=yes weapons are involved, count too.

  Note the actual promotion only happens AFTER a unit has destroyed MORE than VeteranRatio * [Cost](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost)=.

  ## Example

  The default setting for VeteranRatio is 3.0, the default price for a GI is 200 and the default price for a Conscript is 100.
  Therefore, in order to gain veterancy, a GI would have to destroy objects worth 200 * 3.0 + 1 == 601 credits for a promotion of one level. That could be, for example, more than six Conscripts, more than one Robot tank, or more than two Flak Troopers. The Conscript, however, only has to destroy 100 * 3.0 + 1 == 301 credits worth of shit to get promoted, meaning more than two GIs would be enough.

  As you'll surely recognize, this means two things:

  - Destroying an expensive object with a cheap unit results in a very high chance of instant or very soon promotion.
  - Expensive units need to destroy a lot of stuff to get promoted (1 Prism Tank --> $1200 * 3.0 + 1 == $3601 == at least 37 Conscripts).

  ## Exceptions

  Objects flagged as [DontScore](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DontScore)=yes or [Insignificant](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Insignificant)=yes do not count as kills, and therefore don't add to the total amount of credits destroyed by a unit.

  Both the falling speed when [Locomotor=Jumpjet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) units die and the falling speed after Magnetron converts units to `Jumpjet` locomotor and releases traction use `[TechnoType]`→[JumpjetCrash=float](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpjetCrash) instead of this flag.

  The falling speed for Locomotor=Fly aircraft is hard-coded.

  - Connecting with walls. Like [gates](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GDIGateOne), the wall tower can be placed directly on GDI/Allies [wall](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall)[1]. Any adjacent wall sections will also visibly connect to the tower.
  - Whenever the [AI](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AI) builds a wall tower, it will look up its next [base node](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Base_nodes) that has [IsBaseDefense=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsBaseDefense) and try and place that node on top of the tower. This node should be one of the upgrades that can be placed on the tower. If the AI finds such a node but fails to place it on the tower (because the node is not actually an upgrade for the tower), it will skip placing down the node altogether.

  In the absence of a Construction Yard, this unit also counts as "home base" for centering the camera on the player's base using the appropriate keyboard shortcut. This is also important when the "[Short Game](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=Short_Game&action=edit&redlink=1)" game option is set, as the player will not automatically lose when he controls a Base Unit but no structures.

  In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), this flag also lists the [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) that must dock with a [BuildingType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingType) that has Helipad=yes set. This list should include all aircraft with [AirportBound=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirportBound) set in order to make sure that production is not continued when subsequently produced aircraft would have nowhere to land. Failure to list such aircraft results in the first `AirportBound` aircraft beyond the number of available docks switching to "On Hold" state about 40% into the construction process and never completing.

  A useful point is that you can preemptively occupy parking slots at the airport by generating Aircraft existing in the PadAircraft list through `[TechnoType]`→[Spawns=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Spawns).

  - This technique was used in the [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) era when producing VehicleTypes with [Locomotor=Jumpjet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) from airports[ref 1], to prevent players from artificially producing airport-class fighters that would occupy all slots, thereby leaving no space to produce tool-based dummy aircraft and consequently being unable to produce vehicles.

  ## Notes

  However, [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) (and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge)) do not distinguish between factions so the Engineer spawned will always be the infantry defined by this tag.

  Because of a bad algorithm selling a building could go into an infinite loop. The game ensures to at most spawn one infantry unit having Engineer=yes set by just generating a new crew member until it has Engineer=no set. If there are only crew types (set in [AlliedCrew=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedCrew), [Technician=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Technician), Engineer`=` and others) with Engineer=yes, this will never succeed and the game will freeze.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.3.

  When [Technician=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Technician), Engineer`=`, [AlliedCrew=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedCrew) and others weren’t defined, the game crashed when a building was sold or destroyed. This was just because of oversights in both cases.

  - When selling, the flawed `[InfantryType]`→Engineer=yes check happened before the crew type was verified to be set at all.
  - When destroyed, the game checked whether the crew type was set, but then went ahead and tried to write the name of the crew type to the debug log regardless of the result.

  ## Notes
  In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), this comes with the effect of forcibly disabling actively seeking targets, except if it is in an adjacent cell to a building with [Overpowerable=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Overpowerable) and the [secondary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) uses a warhead with [ElectricAssault=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ElectricAssault), in this case, it will actively charge the building. and there does not include Attack Move. Therefore, it is best to use it in combination with [PreventAttackMove=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PreventAttackMove) to prohibit it, just like the respective engineers of the three factions in vanilla. Otherwise, if such infantry possesses a weapon, it will actively use the weapon to attack nearby buildings instead of entering them.
  This also prevents infantry with weapons from getting an `Attack` cursor[1] on any object[2], except if the weapon has a warhead with [BombDisarm=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BombDisarm) set, in which case it will be able to target and successfully be used on objects that have an [IvanBomb](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IvanBomb) attached. Of course, for active attack actions that do not require cursor operation, there is no such restriction. Besides the actively charge and Attack Move mentioned above, for example is that as long as there is no [CanRetaliate=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CanRetaliate) and the weapon can target the other party, it will actively retaliate against enemies using its own weapon, regardless of the weapon type.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations
  If this infantry unit also has [Occupier=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Occupier), then although the repair function from Engineer=yes will be prioritized in cursor control, the unit will be unable to successfully enter target buildings, because in action control, the occupier action is actually executed, and if the target meets conditions such as [CanBeOccupied=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CanBeOccupied) and is already damaged[3], then it will enter the building as a occupier.

  Properly reducing the value enhances the unit's responsiveness, but comes at the cost of increased performance consumption.

  When you create many technos in a same frame (i.e. starting the game with a campaign map that initially has a large number of technos), they will always scan for targets in a synchronous period, causing game lag. Increasing targeting delay alone will not make things better, as their targeting is still synchronized.

  ## Notes

  The replenishment of health will only occur after ammo is replenished to full, and units need to remain docked with the building.

  ## [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) Info

  For this feature to work the reloading has also been changed to reload each aircraft individually. This fixes the issue that reload times seemed to vary for aircraft and the aircraft that landed first was reloaded substantially faster as it required one less interval of ReloadRate.

  New in version 0.B.

  ## Use Cases

  In practice, this flag seems to apply only in the following cases:

  Guard
  When a team is set to the [Guard](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ScriptActions) mission, if any of the team members stray from the group more than this distance to pursue an enemy (because the enemy either attacked them or entered their weapon range), the remaining units in the team will follow suit. Note that the followers will not automatically engage the enemy unless they themselves are provoked.

  Distance to Target
  `Stray` also determines the minimum distance between a team's origin and its destination for the team to actually move there. If the distance is this or less, then the team will assume it's already in its destination and will not move further.

  In other words, if you create or reinforce a team at a [waypoint](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Waypoint), and in the team's [script](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Script) you have that team move to another waypoint or target that's within this many cells from the team's origin waypoint, then the team thinks it's already reached its destination and will proceed to the next [mission](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Team_missions) in the script.

Which means, if the `[General]` section is present in the mpmode file/map, but this flag is not, then its value is multiplied by 100 again for each such case. Which results in a severely overpowered weapon.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.2.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ There is a strange rumor in the community that some people interpret this as being caused by omitting the `%` symbol when `100%` should have been used. Subsequently, this misconception was further propagated by others who claimed the `%` symbol in PrismSupportModifier=150% gets lost during parsing. This then led some to assert that using decimal notation like `1.5` could solve the problem. However, this is completely erroneous.

  Here[1], the interval at which a specified tower supports another tower does not receive the ROF multiplier. Sometimes, due to the reduced attack interval of the supported tower, it cannot receive support for every attack, even though according to the configuration file, the attack interval and support interval appear to have been set to the same value.

  - For example, in vanilla[2], in skirmish mode, a Brutal Enemy's Prism Tower has an actual attack interval that becomes faster due to `[Easy]`→[ROF=.8](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF), but the support interval remains unchanged, thus there is an intermittent issue where support cannot be provided[3].

  TargetDistanceCoefficientDefault specifies the threat rating scan range globally in General section. TechnoTypes (units/infantries etc.) can override this global value with [TargetDistanceCoefficient](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TargetDistanceCoefficient) in their sections. Enemy target selection is affected depending upon if the enemy object is inside the scan range or outside the scan range. The effect of this threat rating is only witnessed in cases where the subject is free to choose its target and applies to cases like the AI script actions of Attack TargetType (0,n). Vanilla game [rules(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules.ini) has this value set to -10. This value is a kind of percentage of the map size (longest length from corner to corner) which can be converted to number of cells for scan range. For the lower negative values like -10, it more or less evens out at specific number of cell range for various map sizes. For the largest negative number of -1, the range covers the entire map except few cells short of the map size.

  ## Effect on AI Script actions of Attack TargetType (0,n) in TS/RA2/YR games

  Target selection when the objects are outside the threat rating scan range:

  When the enemy objects are outside threat rating scan range, select the object which was built first. Built first unit could mean, the target could be one of starting units, if those are not present then it could be the free units that comes with buildings like harvesters. In pre-placed units/structures, the first built is the first in their respective lists in the map files. After the first selected target is destroyed, next target will be evaluated again based on whether any of the enemy objects falls within the scan range or not. Any value in [SpecialThreatValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpecialThreatValue) does not affect the target selection when those fall outside the scan range.

  On 0,1 (Attack anything) - Attack the first unit/aircraft/infantry/building produced by the enemy in that order. Meaning if no unit exists then the first aircraft produced by that enemy and so on.

  On 0,2 (Attack buildings) - Attack the first building produced by the enemy.

  On 0,5 (Attack vehicles) - Attack the first unit produced by the enemy.

  Similar is the case for other Attack TargetType (0,n) script actions.

  Target selection when any enemy object(s) is/are within the threat rating scan range:

  When the enemy objects are available within the threat rating scan range, select the nearest. If more than 1 object are equidistant, then give preference to the object with SpecialThreatValue=1. In equidistant case, if both the objects have same value in SpecialThreatValue then select the one which was built first by the enemy. After the first selected target is destroyed, next target will be evaluated again based on whether any of the enemy objects falls within the scan range or not.

  When there are objects both inside and outside the threat rating scan range, the case of within scan range applies. These 0,n script action are repetitive in nature, meaning that after the first selected target is destroyed, the team members will go on to select the next target based on the scan range.

  Irrespective of what values other threat rating coefficient flags hold like [MyEffectivenessCoefficientDefault](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MyEffectivenessCoefficientDefault), there is no effect seen when making target selection due to the strength, threat posed, weapon range/damage etc. of these enemy objects.

  - Ensures enemy objects pose a higher threat than friendly or allied objects
  - Influences AI target selection behavior

  ## Values

  - Use decimal values (coefficients) instead of percentages
  - Example: Use 2.0 instead of 200

  ## Special Cases

  For units with Cyborg set to yes:

  - This setting is ignored when the unit is badly damaged and has Berzerk set to yes
  - In this case, the unit will consider friendly and allied units equally to enemy units as potential targets

  The death weapon triggered by the above method does not conflict with Explodes=yes; they work together.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Because in vanilla, units with a death process can die again during the death process, for units with Explodes=yes that can trigger the weapon by crashing, they will explode once immediately after dying in the air, and may explode again immediately upon landing with probability; if they land on large buildings, they may die several more times, introducing multiple full death explosions, and then explode once more when the entity is actually removed upon landing.

  - After the fix in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build 12, Explodes=yes will only explode once when dying in the air, and units that can trigger the weapon by crashing will explode once more additionally upon landing.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ The fact that units can have a crash process and collide with the ground indicates that they were originally in the air and can crash.

  Ares had changed the rules regarding frame usage, but starting from version 3.0, this was reverted to be consistent with the vanilla rules.

  Example: For a bombcur.shp with the frames A, B, C, D, and E, previous versions of Ares would flicker between (A B), (B C), (C D), (D E). Now, like in the original game, it will flicker (A B) (C D), ignoring E because the frame count is odd (it will be used as Death Bomb frame, though.
  Migration: This change is hardcoded. Getting back the old behavior would require to duplicate all frames but the first and the last one.

  The `bombcurs.shp` should have the following format:

  (2 * timebomb_frames) + deathbomb_frame
  deathbomb_frame is optional.

BunkerWeaponRangeBonus="""
  Defines a global bonus to the weapons' [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) when they are fired from inside Tank Bunkers.

  Unlike the [OccupyWeaponRange](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OccupyWeaponRange) flag, this is a bonus because there are no other shooters to worry about.

  ## Notes

  This only changes the weapon's range, and does not affect the active acquisition range.

  - However, if a unit enters a bunker, its acquisition range will use the original range of the longest among all current weapons[1] plus the increment set by [AirRangeBonus](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirRangeBonus)[2], and then take the smaller value between that and the used weapon's range plus BunkerWeaponRangeBonus.
  - For example: with BunkerWeaponRangeBonus=2, a unit in a bunker with primary weapon Range=4, [secondary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) Range=5, and AirRangeBonus=1, when using the primary weapon to attack a target, actually uses `6` as the acquisition range, which also exactly matches the actual range. But even if AirRangeBonus and/or the secondary weapon's Range continue to increase, since the primary weapon's Range + BunkerWeaponRangeBonus`= 4 + 2 = 6`, it will ultimately be limited to a range of `6` cells.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ For an [IFV](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IFV_Weapon_System), there is only one [currentprimary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary#Current_Primary_Weapon).
  - ↑ Since AirRangeBonus can be set to negative and still participate in the calculation, it is useful for adjusting the range after the unit enters the bunker.

  When an aircraft has [FlyBy=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlyBy), it does not turn to a specific direction but maintains its flight direction before landing.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  In fact, for regular aircraft that return to a helipad rather than a spawnee launcher unit, the actual landing direction always uses the direction of the airport building's body. For buildings preplaced on the map, it is the 256-division circle angle value specified by their 6th parameter.

  As with UIName, there is a Name flag at the beginning of the `[General]` section.

This was, however, never seen in use and was probably dropped in favor of differently named, overriding INIs.

[ObjectType]:[AbstractType]
Image
AlphaImage="""
  Alpha images are a very nice lighting feature used in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), but left unused in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge). Alpha images are grayscale SHPs that are attached to, for example, a lightpost. If one is attached to an object, the object automatically starts emitting light, with the brightness of the light at a given pixel determined by the index number of the corresponding pixel of the alpha image. In other words: The light is modeled after the image and its brightness is defined by the brightness of the pixels. This allows a total customization of the light's shape.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Comparison with standard lightsBenefitsDrawbacksNo lag at all. "Tiled" lights cause lag when placing them down, overlapping, destroying, etc. Alpha images do not.Only affects brightness, not coloring.Looks much better than the standard "tiled" light.Remains active even when the owner object is powered down, or when 'Turn off building' map action is applied.Customizable shape/amount/area of effect.Is known to cause building selection bracket discoloration, as well as discoloration of line trails.[1]
  - ↑ These are, however, barely visible, and usually don't affect your perception of the game.

  Limitations
  - This light does not follow around moving objects. So while it is possible to create shiny headlights for Grizzly Tanks, the light itself will be left behind where the Grizzly was spawned - while the Grizzly moves around the map just as always.
  - Cannot be animated.

  ## Using Alpha Images

  Using an alpha image is fairly easy: First of all, you need the actual image. Create it, turn it into an SHP, and store it your expand(md)##.mix. Once you have that, just put AlphaImage=yourAlphaImageFileName (without the `.shp` extension) on your object, and everything should be fine.

  The original, unused, lightpost alpha image should be called alphatst.shp, and is included in the game. It seems, however, to be wrongly named (sibmlr.shp). A correctly named alphatst.shp can be found at the bottom of this page.

  Note: AlphaImages should be saved using Compression 1, like the mouse cursors, to work properly.

  A note on [XCC Mod Creator](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/XCC_Mod_Creator)
  Alpha images seem to get corrupted when read from an ecache*.mix. Since XMC automatically puts SHPs in that file, you have to abuse a category like Video to have your alpha image(s) placed directly in the game directory. As long as it doesn't end up in ecache*.mix, there's no problem using alpha images with XMC.

  ## The Alpha Image Palette

  Alpha images are normal SHPs, but they do not have an associated palette. Rather, their color index is mapped to brightness values, making index #127 neutral, i.e. no light change, and #128-#255 gradually becoming brighter, with #255 being the brightest. The best way to illustrate this is to use a greyscale palette from black (index 0) to white (index 255) (see here) - the brighter the color is, the brighter the light will be.
  Using any color below #127 apparently requires Compression 1 to work properly, otherwise crashes and/or distortions will happen.

  ## Examples

  LOOK DADDY, NO LAG!
  The most prominent example of alpha image usage is DCoder's "LOOK DADDY, NO LAG!" screenshot. Other screenshots to note are Renegade's alpha test screenshots, illustrating not only how good correct alphas can look ingame, but also what happens if you use index 126 and below (without using Compression 1). Important to note here is that the full-palette screenshot was taken on Arena, after the same image had crashed the game to desktop (just by scrolling to where it was) on Bay of Pigs.

  The NoSpawnAlt filename is derived from the normal [Image](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Image) by suffixing it with `WO` ("without").

  ## On [OverlayTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OverlayTypes)

  Defines the probability divisor for this overlay being killed, default 1, used in `Min(1, Damage/Strength)` to get the probability of an overlay losing one layer.

  - Note that overlays are not independent objects in the game; all interactions with overlays are actually with the cell where the overlay is located.
  - That is to say, for overlays, Strength is actually used to calculate the probability of being destroyed/losing one layer, rather than the classic "health points" concept.
  - Correspondingly, killing overlays only depends on Damage and whether there is a kill flag for that type of overlay, without checking warhead ratio.

  For overlays with `[OverlayType]`→[Wall=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall#Overlays), you need to use warheads with `[Warhead]`→[Wall=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall#Warheads). At this time, for weapons that can target walls and can remove one layer per shot (100%), the number of shots required for wall-type overlays depends on the value set in `[OverlayType]`→[DamageLevels=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DamageLevels).

  - If this wall-type overlay also has `[OverlayType]`→[Armor=wood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Armor) set, then warheads with `[Warhead]`→[Wood=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wood) can also cause damage according to the same rule. However, the difference is: for standalone (not connected to others) OverlayTypes, this can destroy the last two Damage Levels in one go.

  For overlays with `[OverlayType]`→[Tiberium=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberium), you need to use warheads with `[Warhead]`→[Tiberium=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberium). The number of layers, whether 1 or 2, depends on the maturity of the ore.

  For overlays that have both (the latter inherently has an effect equivalent to `[OverlayType]`→[Armor=wood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Armor)):

  - If the incoming warhead only has `[Warhead]`→Tiberium=yes, then it is calculated according to the ore rule;
  - If it has `[Warhead]`→Wall=yes or `[Warhead]`→Wood=yes, then it is calculated according to the wall rule with the number of layers being `[OverlayType]`→DamageLevels value + 1.

  Of course, if the incoming warhead has `[Warhead]`→[WallAbsoluteDestroyer=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WallAbsoluteDestroyer) and `[OverlayType]`→Wall=yes, then this takes precedence over the above conventional calculation rules.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If a unit has Strength=0 (possibly due to negligence in forgetting to set the value), then such a unit will not join the [Team](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TeamTypes) and execute the [Script](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ScriptTypes) like other units, even if it is in a [Task Force](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TaskForces).

  Editor's note: In the base games, the radial indicator is also restricted to a BuildingType's Primary (as can be seen with Yuri's Gattling Turret when it has HasRadialIndicator=yes).

Theater
NewTheater="""
  This tag specifies whether or not the game uses special naming logic to get the objects image based on the theater of the map; .shp assets formatted with alternate snow art utilizing this tag should have their files organized such that the second letter of the file corresponds to the theater type. A for "Arctic" and G for "Generic". in a snow map, the game will look for files with the A prefix first, and if there are none, it will fall back to using files with the G prefix. In the games art and rules .ini entries, the A prefix is always used.

  For example, if one were to make a new refinery and made separate snow and temperate art for it, then the files would be named as so

  Temperate version:

  mgrefn
  mgrefnbb
  mgrefn_a ; and so on
  Snow version:

  marefn
  marefnbb
  marefn_a
  And in the rules and art.ini entries for this building, the name [MAREFN] would always be used (whether or not there actually is the optional snow art files)

  Additionally, this tag means the unit palette is used to draw this image.

  In Tiberian Sun and Red Alert 2, the tag would only work if the first letter of the buildings name started with G, N, or C; Yuri's Revenge adds the functionality to Y prefix letter. File names can also use this logic for the other four theaters in YR, though doing so is mostly redundant as special art is typically not made for any theater besides snow.
  Ares DLL expands logic onto all prefixes, not just G, N, C, Y.

LandTargeting="""
  This flag determines whether an object can fire on land units (as opposed to naval units) or not. In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), it additionally can allow land targeting only with the secondary weapon.
  This flag, along with [NavalTargeting](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NavalTargeting), was likely introduced because technically, ships are ground-level units as well, and a simple AG=yes would have does allow Submarines, for example, to fire torpedoes through the water, over the ground, into a tank. This, of course, is not desired. Therefore, the additional target area distinction between "Land" and "Naval" was created. The originally intended [AN](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AN) and [AS](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AS) were probably dismissed because they were not "complex" enough, allowing only a simple "Can fire on submarines? Yes." rather than something like "Can fire on submarines? Yes, but only with it's Secondary.".

NavalTargeting="""
  This flag determines whether an object can fire on naval units (as opposed to land units) or not. It has several more options to choose from than [LandTargeting](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTargeting), and YR expanded it by one more, adding the possible restriction to only use the primary weapon on naval targets.

  This flag, along with LandTargeting, was likely introduced because technically, ships are ground-level units as well, and a simple AG=yes would have does allow Submarines, for example, to fire torpedoes through the water, over the ground, into a tank. This, of course, is not desired. Therefore, the additional target area distinction between "Land" and "Naval" was created. The originally intended AN and AS were probably dismissed because they were not "complex" enough, allowing only a simple "Can fire on submarines? Yes." rather than something like "Can fire on submarines? Yes, but only with it's Secondary.".

  ## What is the difference between 5 and 7

  By analyzing the operation mode of the program, it can be seen that this is actually a multi branch selection structure, but the special value is 012346. Other values are the same, such as -1, 5, 7, 8, etc. Correspondingly, there is no difference between NavalTargeting=5 and 7 in fact. The comment on line 3684 of YR1.001-rulesmd.ini was completely written by Westwood haphazardly, and it also misled many authors of tutorials and editing manuals. Whether not actively attacking targets on land or using Secondary on targets on land, they are controlled by LandTargeting=2 instead ofNavalTargeting=7.

  ## Primary/Secondary Land/Naval issues

  NavalTargeting=1
  LandTargeting=2
  NavalTargeting=3
  LandTargeting=2
  NavalTargeting=7
  LandTargeting=1
  NavalTargeting=4
  LandTargeting=2
  This section is just ment to show that Naval- & LandTargeting aren't mutually exclusive, and can confuse the hell out of you as well as the game. Apart from the usual checks, you should watch them double closely if you're doing any extended Primary/Secondary magic.

  ## Notes

  The logic only operating when the target is on cell which [LandType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTypes) is water or beach.

  And actually executed after [LandTargeting](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTargeting).(although not conflicting)

  For a [VehicleType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleType) that uses a [Spawner](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Spawner) launcher weapon as [Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) (such as `[DEST]`), if it simultaneously sets NavalTargeting=5 (or 7, 8, -1 and etc.) and [LandTargeting=2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTargeting), then as long as the carrier based aircraft(not missiles) is launched once, even if it switches to using [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) for fire, the SpawnLauncher will continue to load and issue attack commands to the carrier based aircraft.

SpeedType="""
  SpeedType defines the way this [unit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitTypes) will move over different [types of terrain](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTypes). By default units with different SpeedTypes are affected differently by the same terrain. See [LandTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTypes) for more information.

  ## Notes

  All available SpeedTypes:

  - Foot
  - Track
  - Wheel
  - Float
  - Winged
  - Hover[2]
  - Amphibious[2]
  - Creep[3]
  - FloatBeach[4]

  Note that the SpeedType=Winged will always grant `100%` movement ability over any tile.

  For [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes), except when SpeedType=Float which achieves the effect of [WaterBound=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WaterBound) and ignores the [Buildable](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Buildable) value of [tile types](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TMP) during construction, there is no significant difference between other SpeedType values.

  For [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) select cells according to the rules of SpeedType=Track and MovementZone=Normal when pathfinding, which is why in the original game it was impossible for AircraftTypes to reach water-type cells through conventional means.

  - Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#46, this hard-coded value has been removed.
  - Ares' `[SuperWeaponTypes]`→[Deliver.Types=List of TechnoTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Deliver.Types) also follow this rule when creating BuildingTypes that do not have SpeedType=Float or WaterBound=yes to locate positions.

  ## Cite Notes

  - ↑ SpeedType=Track & SpeedType=Wheel are the defaults for [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes).

IsTrain="""
  Determines whether or not this VehicleType should be considered a train.

  ## Notes

  This causes a unit to have several special behaviours in order to act like a train:

  - It causes the unit to be immune to capture by a [VehicleThief](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleThief) type unit as player control can cause the unit to do things that break the illusion of train like behavior.
  Note that improperly setting up target waypoints for train movements does the same, see fooage below↓.
    - Note that improperly setting up target waypoints for train movements does the same, see fooage below↓.
  - It also prevents the unit from turning a full `180°` and face backwards like normal vehicles. This prevents it from turning back on itself as normal units can but as a real train could not.
  Note that train locomotives, if [MovementRestrictedTo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MovementRestrictedTo) is either undefined or the valid [LandType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTypes) is placed appropriately, can turn `135°` at maximum without needing to actually move (`135°` is almost a `180°` turn but lacking just one more `45°` increment for a `180°`).
  For ground units, this will make them ignore commands to move to the grid position behind themselves, including those with [Locomotor=Walk](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Walk). However, for [Tunnel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Tunnel)[1], [Jumpjet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Jumpjet), and [Fly](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Fly), they are not constrained by this. For more locomotors, see ↓.

For more locomotors, see ↓.
  - IsTrain also has the effect of causing any unit or building, in a cell the IsTrain unit is moving into to be destroyed using the warhead specified by `[CombatDamage]`→[C4Warhead=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/C4Warhead). The unit's pathfinding sometime will ignore buildings in the way to its destination and simply move into them, including buildings owned by the same player, though it will not do so consistently, nor will the buildings the train locomotive moves into be destroyed consistently.
  IsTrain causes crush to have a hardcoded minimum interval[2].
  As a result, when a large number of units with IsTrain=yes move together, although they will crush each other and be destroyed, a small number will still manage to escape unscathed.
  Each time IsTrain crushes, it inflicts hardcoded `10,000`[3] damage on the target and inflicts hardcoded `20` damage upon itself[4].
  If the crushed object is an [OverlayType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OverlayType) (e.g., [wall](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall)), the vehicle will pass directly through it without any effect, unless [MovementZone=CrusherAll](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MovementZone) is additionally set.
  If the crushed object is a [TerrainType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TerrainType) (e.g., tree), the vehicle will pass through and cause damage to itself as usual, but the terrain types remain physically present at their original location.
  This differs from regular crush behavior which successfully destroys objects, though their images may linger until the screen is refreshed.
    - As a result, when a large number of units with IsTrain=yes move together, although they will crush each other and be destroyed, a small number will still manage to escape unscathed.
  - This flag also determines what units leave a crate when destroyed if `[Basic]`→[TrainCrate=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TrainCrate) in a map file. The train logic works best when the unit is restricted to a specific terrain type that is laid in one cell "Tracks" for the unit to follow using MovementRestrictedTo. The terrain type most commonly used for this is RailRoad and is placed using a dedicated overlay set or terrain tiles.
  - IsTrain units are unable to perform Scatter moves on their own; might be a deal-breaker for those who want a special "crush everything" unit that ignores [OmniCrushResistant=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OmniCrushResistant).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  [Locomotor={4A582742-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Hover) (Hover) should not be used on such Vehicles unless they're on a straight line.

  - Hovering train locomotives and compartments will stop at each corner to rotate, which eventually leads to bigger and bigger gaps within the train.

  As mentioned earlier↑, the effect of 135° on units using different Locomotors varies. The specific effect of IsTrain does not depend on the Type to which the unit belongs, but on the Locomotor used by the unit. Most ground locomotives are similar to Drive. However, if the unit uses one of the three Locomotors: [Walk](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Walk), [Mech](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Mech), or [Hover](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Hover), it will not pathfind correctly and will treat buildings on the path as obstacles, attempting to destroy them to pass through.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ For vehicles that move short distances and actually use [Drive](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Drive) as their locomotor, they are obviously not included in this.
  - ↑ However, for the infantry that this unit runs over, it often ensures that they will meet God with `100%` certainty.
  - ↑ Due to the previous characteristic, if the unit's movement speed is slow enough, it is still possible to cause 2 (or more) instances of damage to the same object.
  - ↑ The values here are not affected by `[CombatDamage]`→[MaxDamage=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MaxDamage) and the [Verses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses) parameters of [C4Warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/C4Warhead), etc.

  As a special case, GuardRange is also used to determine the 'auto-fill' wall placement distance; the number of cells between which a new wall can be connected to an existing wall (assuming there are no obstructions).

  If the GuardRange is greater than the weapon's Range, the unit will attempt to target enemies outside its firing range. However, due to insufficient range, it cannot fire and remains in a perpetual targeting state. In this scenario, you need to add [DefaultToGuardArea=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DefaultToGuardArea) to make it approach the target.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If manually specifying this flag instead of using the default rules, the unit's target acquisition will not consider whether the weapon can actually fire at the target. For example, if the current primary weapon has `[Projectiles]`→[SubjectToWalls=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SubjectToWalls),

  - Under default conditions the target acquisition mechanism will ignore targets blocked by [OverlayTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OverlayTypes) with [Wall=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall).

  - If the unit can carry `Passengers` any passengers inside will perish.

  [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftType) are a special case. Even without Explodes=yes set, an AircraftType will always fire its [current primary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary#Current_Primary_Weapon) at the cell it crashes into. If DeathWeapon is present, it is used instead of the primary weapon.

  AliasCLSIDdefaultSpeedTypevalue[1]Levitate{3DC0B295-6546-11D3-80B0-00902792494C}Hover(?)Levitate locomotor. Only available inFirestorm.- Used by [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes), has several hardcoded features:
  The unit will periodically move in a random direction unless given a specific movement or attack command, similar to [Visceroids](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SmallVisceroid).
  The unit will move like a [jellyfish](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Jellyfish)[2] or squid, propelling itself forward while expelling gas in the form of a [particle system](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ParticleSystems) of the type`[GasPuffSys]`.
  [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF), [Speed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed) and [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) of the unit's weapon(s) are ignored. The unit will attempt to hug the target and if successful, deals the weapon's [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) every few seconds. It will also attack any enemies that happen on its path while simultaneously moving towards the main target.

  Drive{4A582741-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}ifCrusher=yes→Track, else →Wheel.Drive locomotor. Used by ground-basedVehicleTypes.- If used by [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) and with a very low [Speed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed) set, they will stop directly upon approaching the target cell for the first time and will never complete the movement action, nor can this action be overridden with new commands.
  Hover{4A582742-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}HoverHover locomotor. Used byhoveringVehicleTypes (e.g. Hover MLRS, Robot Tank).- The relevant parameters are defined in the hover vehicle characteristics section under the global `[General]` settings.
  - In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), this Locomotor should not be used for fast ([Speed=31](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed) or higher) vehicles, as the movement trajectory will become highly erratic, making it difficult to reach the destination and also challenging to be hit by incoming [Arcing](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Arcing) type projectiles.
  - This Locomotor should also not be used on [IsTrain=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsTrain) vehicles; Hover Train locomotives can't crush Hover Train compartments, and they can't turn properly on corners without stopping and breaking the illusion of train-like behavior.
  - Can be disabled by [PoweredUnit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PoweredUnit)/[EMP](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EMEffect)/[ion storm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ion_storm) in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) and forced to the ground.
  If over water, they will sink.

  Tunnel{4A582743-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}same toDrive,notUnderground![3]Tunnel locomotor. Used by burrowing VehicleTypes.- The relevant parameters are defined in the subterrainean vehicle characteristics section under the global `[General]` settings. (Only one TunnelSpeed=int)
  - When the number of cells between the unit and the farthest [AllowBurrowing=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AllowBurrowing) cell before the target cell exceeds `11`, the unit will switch to burrowing mode. Otherwise, its behavior is basically the same as Locomotor=Drive.
  Burrowing speed is determined by the global `[General]`→[TunnelSpeed=int](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TunnelSpeed) with `[TechnoType]`→[Speed=int](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed).
  The burrowing animation is specified by the global `[AudioVisual]`→[Dig=Animation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Dig).
  The burrowing sound effect is defined by the global `[AudioVisual]`→[DigSound=Sound entry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DigSound).
  However, since [Westwood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Westwood) considered this feature unnecessary during [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) development and rushed production, they reused this parameter for nuclear missile alert sounds.
  In [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares), you can specify individually through `[SuperWeaponType]`→[SW.ActivationSound=Sound entry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SW.ActivationSound).
  [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) also extends the definitions of burrowing animations and sound effects, allowing separate specifications for digging-in and digging-out sounds, See #References.

  Walk{4A582744-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}same toDriveWalk locomotor. Used by ground-basedInfantryTypes.- Only when the distance between the current location and the target location is less than `17` leptons, it is considered as arrived, this Locomotor should not be used for fast ([Speed=14](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed) or higher) infantry.[4]
  - The image in water is determined by the [Sequence](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Sequence) parameter.
  - Infantry in mid-air always use `infshdw.shp` to render shadows directly below them.
  - If deployed via DropPod, `pod.shp` will be attached to the unit's image while airborne.
  - Infantry using this movement pattern tend to intermittently attempt moving two steps due south/north before readjusting direction when moving southwest/northeast at insufficient Speed.
  DropPod{4A582745-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}Hover(?)(indifferent)Drop Pod locomotor (referred to as ballistic locomotor inlocos.tlb). Used by falling objects and Drop Pods.- The relevant parameters are defined in the droppod flight characteristics section under the global `[General]` settings.
  - DropPod is actually a temporary movement mode.
  For example, units deployed by super weapons with Type=DropPod will use this movement mode before landing, but will clear it after landing and switch back to their original movement mode.
  Therefore, in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), it is completely feasible to assign the `DropPod` Locomotor to targets through [IsLocomotor=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsLocomotor) warheads.
  However, [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#? broke this functionality, causing guaranteed Fatal Errors when used.
  Correspondingly, if a unit directly writes Locomotor=DropPod, it will immediately lose the basic attribute of movement mode when on the ground, and then enjoy the "delight" of Internal Errors.

  If produced by a War Factory with [WeaponsFactory=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponsFactory), it will get stuck at the entrance.
  Even for voxel-based vehicles, their shadows will render on the unit itself rather than the ground directly below.
  Cannot properly use deployment functions and cannot serve as an ore hauler.
  When attacking targets beyond the `[Weapon]`→[Range=float](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) setting while currently airborne, it will not approach the target.

    - When attacking targets beyond the `[Weapon]`→[Range=float](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) setting while currently airborne, it will not approach the target.
  - On the other hand, such vehicles also have some unique functions that can potentially be turned to an advantage over AircraftTypes:
  They are not forced to return to a docking structure after finishing a move or attack order and can circle an area indefinitely.
  Combined with their ability to passively engage enemy units in the same manner as ground units (but contrary to aircraft, which only attack targets explicitly given to them), they can thus be used as "patrols".
  Flying VehicleTypes are also able to engage other aerial targets, making them useful to simulate fighter aircraft, although this feature has lost its relative advantage through the addition of air-to-air combat by AircraftTypes in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares).
  Since the body of a aircraft is a turret, if [TurretSpins=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretSpins) is added, the body of the vehicle will rotate like the turret.

  - Units will be instantly destroyed when encountering [ion storm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ion_storm) from [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) while airborne.
  The bombing pattern is determined by `[TechnoType]`→[Fighter=bool](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Fighter). For projectiles with ROT`>1`, the fixed/alternating continuous firing mode is determined by `[General]`→[CurleyShuffle=bool](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CurleyShuffle).
  If a unit has `[AircraftType]`→[FlyBy=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlyBy), it will ignore global landing direction definitions and land in whatever orientation it returns.
  Since `[AircraftType]`→[Landable=bool](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Landable) defaults to `no`, you need to manually set it to `yes` to allow aircraft to land.

  Teleport{4A582747-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}same toDriveTeleport locomotor. Used by teleportingTechnoTypes, and it is used as the default value.- The relevant parameters are defined in the Reinforcement/Chrono Stuff section under the global `[General]` settings.
  The animation during movement is defined by `[General]`→[WarpOut=Animation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WarpOut).
  `[General]`→[WarpIn=Animation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WarpIn) was originally intended to define the "warping in" animation for chrono movement, but was eventually deprecated. Both arrival and departure animations now use the above setting.
  As of [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#12, this feature has been restored. However, since an animation with an incorrect palette was previously used here, you may need to manually set it to `WARPOUT`.

  Mech{55D141B8-DB94-11d1-AC98-006008055BB5}same toDriveMech locomotor. Used by walker-likeVehicleTypes, such asMammoth Mk.IIinTiberian Sun.- Only when the distance between the current location and the target location is less than `16` leptons, this Locomotor should not be used for fast ([Speed=14](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed) or higher) vehicles.[4]
  - The program hard-codes units to change their facing direction once after passing a fixed `[distance/speed]` threshold, originally used in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) for the Mammoth MK.II's walking shake effect. (In many cases, simply using `Drive` is more practical, like Terror Drone.)
  There's a minor visual bug related to the wobble, in that it changes the movement trajectory of the unit when moving in certain directions. See this example. This bug is more pronounced on very low unit [speeds](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed).In addition, this is a hard coded behavior. Even if it uses voxels, it will be displayed See this example. In other words, if the number of SHP vehicle surfaces is small enough, this problem is completely invisible.

  - Units with this locomotor are hardcoded not to [tilt](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsTilter), even include sink.
  So you can use this Locomotor to make the ship sink vertically when sinking instead of having a tilting process first.
  For large ships, since they cannot break into two sections, vertical sinking might be more reasonable.

  Ship{2BEA74E1-7CCA-11d3-BE14-00104B62A16C}FloatUsed by ships. Just same toDrive, but AI recognition requires this.- Once thought to cause them to "tilt" when destroyed, but that is false. Any [VehicleType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleType) can be made to sink if it [weighs](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Weight) more than `[General]`→[ShipSinkingWeight=float](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShipSinkingWeight), no matter what Locomotor it uses. Even the Amphibious Transports using `Hover` Locomotor will "tilt"/sink if they weigh enough.

  ## Notes

  Although the rules' comment about Locomotors specifically uses "objects" instead of "units", and there is a default of "statue" that probably applies to BuildingTypes, setting a Locomotor on buildings does not seem to have any effect (positive or negative) whatsoever. Furthermore, the Guide's first sentence about Locomotors is "Should not be used on BuildingTypes". This, however, suggests something does happen. Either way it is assumed that Locomotors are parsed and valid on BuildingTypes, but simply do not have any effect. For the sake of the game's sanity, one should not set them.

  For units with Locomotor=Teleport|Tunnel|Fly, their inability to tilt properly has been fixed in the [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) engine.

  Units registered under the name `[COW]` will always move randomly regardless of their Locomotor mode, with no type restrictions.

  - [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.1 has allowed free customization of this effect.

  Units registered under the name `[DESO]` are forced to determine weapon deployment based on the radiation residue level beneath them.

  - Ares... Ares attempted to allow free customization.

  - ↑ [InfantryType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryType) always defaults to [SpeedType=Foot](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpeedType) regardless of what Locomotor=CLSID is set to.
  - ↑ This locomotor works in conjunction with the flag [Jellyfish](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Jellyfish); the unit must have this flag enabled for some of these features to work properly. In addition, movement and behavior controls found in the section `[LEVITATION]` apply.
  - ↑ In some old tutorials, there was a misleading default setting of SpeedType=Underground, which originated from an error in DeeZire's [The Guide](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeeZire%27s_Red_Alert_2_and_Yuris_Revenge_INI_Editing_Guide). But there is never an available value for SpeedType called `Underground`, this was likely caused when he reverse-engineered the program code and mistakenly took the available values from the nearby Layer statement as belonging to SpeedType.
  - ↑ 4.0 4.1 Indeed, values such as `20` and `21` are also available, but the vast majority of larger numbers starting from 14 are not available or can only be moved in a "continuous multiple teleportation" manner in a specific direction.
  Only a very few number of values are work as normal as `1` to `13`. However, when testing `8` directions performance every Speed=1 to `100` one by one, their arrangement is almost random.
  Therefore, unless you are willing to waste time testing and summarizing the algorithm one by one, you only need to remember that Speed`≤13` is normal.

"""
SlowdownDistance="""
  Specifies the distance, in leptons, that this object must be from its intended target location before it applies de-acceleration.

  ## Notes

  Using really high numbers here like `10,000` (approximately `39` cells) will give an aircraft a behaviour similar to the Aurora Bomber from [Generals](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Generals): the aircraft will approach its target at full [speed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed), unload its weapon, then return to base, and as it does the latter, it will fly very slow, as the base it intends to land is within the very large SlowdownDistance, thus it deccelerates.

  - This only works if the aircraft is firing its weapon and either has [Fighter=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Fighter) or [FlyBy=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlyBy) or uses a [strafing pattern](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Strafing)[1], thus avoiding counting the actual attack as part of its move.
  - If the weapon is fired in a "helicopter" fashion (like the Orca Fighter in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)), the attack is performed at the end of a movement assignment, and thus the aircraft will slow down when approaching the target it was ordered to attack.

  For units with Locomotor=Fly[2], they need to decelerate to `0` at the destination. If their `(Speed/ROT)` value is too high, causing them to be unable to reach the target point when approaching due to excessive movement speed and insufficient turning speed, then they will circle around the destination, with the radius determined by the `(Speed/ROT)` value. A very useful point is that you can solve this problem by increasing the SlowdownDistance value to make them start decelerating earlier.

  - SlowdownDistance=0 means starting to decelerate only when the distance to the destination is `0` lepton. However, units with Locomotor=Fly have an inherent initial speed, so they will inevitably overshoot the `0` lepton position, causing them to never be able to decelerate and stop. If the `(Speed/ROT)` of such a unit is small enough, it will oscillate near that point. If we ignore the small distances of oscillation, then SlowdownDistance=0 for Locomotor=Fly units is equivalent to the effect of [BalloonHover=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BalloonHover) for Locomotor=Jumpjet[3] units.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Due to the special property of SlowdownDistance=0, it causes the `Move` action to never complete, and thus will not land after approaching the destination. Therefore, it may cause the distance between such a unit and the moving target to be unable to be less than the length set by `[General]`→[Stray=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Stray).

VHPScan="""
  This flag influences the way the unit in question chooses its targets when it has not explicitly been assigned a target.

  Each object on the map has an internal "projected health" independent from its current health. This projected health gets reduced by the estimated amount of damage the unit will likely take on impact every time a projectile not set to [inaccurate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Inaccurate) is launched towards the unit.
  This provides attackers currently automatically seeking targets with information about whether it is efficient to attack this unit or not (e.g. if two projectiles are currently in the air which will kill the unit once they impact, there is no reason a new attacker should bother picking the same unit as its next target - it will be dead in a moment anyway).

  The projected health cannot go below -30 hitpoints, and it will increase every 4 frames until it equals the real health. Repairing a unit will set the projected health to the current health.

  ## Values

  - None

  - Normal

  - Strong

  Please keep in mind that this flag is only part of the entire system that is responsible for automatic targeting.

  ## Examples

  3 Grizzlies are attacked by 3 Apocalypse Tanks. 2 Apos attack 1 Grizzly, the other Apo attacks another one; one Grizzly stays unattacked. Due to prior damage on the second Grizzly, the single Apo kills his target first. He now has to scan for new targets. At this point, the other two Apos each fire a shot towards their Grizzly. Each time a bullet leaves one of their barrels, the Grizzly's projected health gets reduced by the amount of damage the bullet will likely cause once it impacts. As the bullets fly towards the Grizzly, the single Apo checks its projected health. He sees that the Grizzly is projected to be dead once all bullets impacted, and chooses the unattacked Grizzly instead.

  2 Grizzlies attack 3 Flak Tracks. Each picks one, leaving one unattacked and at full health. The Grizzlies' shells do extensive damage to the attacked Flak Tracks. As the two Flak Tracks are below half health and another projectile is on the way to destroy the first one, a third Grizzly enters the combat zone. It queries the Flak Tracks' projected health, and realizes that two of them have less than half their strength and one will be destroyed within a split second. It chooses to attack the damaged one that is not destroyed when the projectile impacts.

  As you can see, `VHPScan` helps uncontrolled units to pick their targets more efficiently, leading to a better distribution of firepower.

  - this vehicle should only use [Weapon1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Weapon1) and [EliteWeapon1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EliteWeapon1), and ignore all other weapons it has.

  ## Notes

  After firing, the turret's animation plays turret index in reverse. The total cycle duration is determined by the weapon's [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF) and the VehicleType's [BurstDelayX](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BurstDelayX). The delay between each turret switches is then calculated based on the number of turrets.

  ## References

  Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#45, this switching delay can be independently defined at the Weapon level. Refer to Phobos documentation.

  Starting from Phobos Build#48, the new MultiWeapon system allows units with IsChargeTurret=yes to use weapons other than `(Elite)`Weapon1! Refer to Phobos documentation - Multi Weapon.

The weapons do remain loaded by the game as if loaded by a weedguy hack.

  ## Notes

  Although a VehicleType with [Gunner=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Gunner) can be equipped with a weapon by passenger (or rather, switched to a weapon other than `(Elite)`Weapon1 or `(Elite)`Weapon2), it cannot actually fire nor properly trigger [DeployToFire](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployToFire), even virtual weapons like [Spawner=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Spawner).

Primary="""
  Specifies the main weapon of the [TechnoType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoType) for which this flag is set.

  The `Primary` weapon is always used when:

  - Force-firing at the ground
  - Attacking overlays (such as walls). Note that a unit whose [Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) weapon can attack walls, but `Primary` weapon can't, will not, in fact, be able to attack walls.

  - Scanning the area for targets.

  [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) introduced units with special-case methods for specifying weapons - the IFV, Prism Tank and Gattling Cannon use [WeaponX](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponX) in place of `Primary`.

  ## Current Primary Weapon

  The weapon that a unit considers to be its actual primary weapon is not always determined simply by `Primary`. If the unit has both [TurretCount](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretCount) and [WeaponCount](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponCount) flags set then it will use [WeaponX](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponX) instead. If the unit is elite then it will use [ElitePrimary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ElitePrimary) or [EliteWeaponX](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EliteWeaponX) respectively instead.
  If a unit has a current primary weapon then it is used as the unit's default `DeathWeapon`.

  - 4Footnotes

  ## Special Values

  Setting BuildLimit to any negative value has a different effect from the normal behaviour. The absolute value of the number is used as the build limit, however this is now a limit on the number of times you can actually build the unit yourself. For example, if BuildLimit=-5 is set on the GI then you will only be able to build 5 GIs throughout the course of any given game. This is regardless of how many GIs you may have started with or obtain through other means. Once you have personally built |BuildLimit| instances of a unit, that unit's build icon will disappear from the sidebar until the next campaign or skirmish.

  Sidebar icon is not available when BuildLimit is set to 0.

  ## Super Weapons

  Each super weapon type in the game can only be instantiated once per player. If you were to own, say, two Nuclear Missile Silos, you would still only have one Nuclear Missile super weapon available. BuildLimit has no effect on this. Other special-function buildings (such as the Ore Purifier, Industrial Plant and Cloning Vats) can stack their effects - they simply have BuildLimit=1 set for reasons of balance.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  - AI players are not subject to any unit's BuildLimit. AI players will build whichever units are required by the chosen [TaskForce](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TaskForce) regardless of how many instances of those units the AI player already owns.
  - The BuildLimit system was created to allow the inclusion of so-called "hero" units, of which only one is supposed to exist at any given time. As such, the system was only designed to work for BuildLimit=1. Whilst you can set a higher BuildLimit, you will not be able to queue up the entire limit 'in a row' - you will have to queue the last one separately. For example, if you had a unit with BuildLimit=5, you would have to either:
  Queue the first 4, build them, and then queue the final one.
  Queue the first 4, add a different unit to the queue, queue the final one.
  Build a different unit, queue all five, cancel the different unit unless you want it.
  When applied to [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes), it causes the icon to remain clickable for production even when the BuildLimit quantity has been met (if the airport still has available [Dock](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Dock) slots), although the production progress always gets stuck midway and orders cannot be fully canceled.
  Depending on whether it is listed in `[General]`→[PadAircraft=List of AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PadAircraft), PadAircraft will restrict the order quantity as usual when the aircraft on the map hasn't met the BuildLimit.
  For example: [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) not included in PadAircraft can initially place dozens of orders, even though only the quantity constrained by both BuildLimit and available airport Dock slots can actually be produced. The remaining orders will persist in the icon's upper-right corner.
  Furthermore, this leads to a situation where even if existing aircraft of that type are destroyed or removed, the production queue will not resume unless all orders are manually canceled and recreated.

Dock="""

    - 1.1Rules coding
    - 1.2Art coding
    - 1.3Structure-specific info

  ## Docking

  Certain units can dock with their parent structures (aircraft -> AFC, harvester -> refinery, vehicles -> repair bay/tank bunker, ships -> shipyard). Docking can repair/reload/unload the unit or fortify it, depending on the structure.

  - Since these other functions under [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) often hinder reload, it is best for units with [ManualReload=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ManualReload) to choose to use a building with [Bunker=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Bunker) and [UnitReload=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitReload) as the Dock target.

  Rules coding
  Buildings that only certain units can dock with should be listed in the Dock= statement in the unit's code, and the structures themselves should have NumberOfDocks= set (equal to .. number of docking points within a structure, duh). NumberImpassableRows= is also needed - otherwise units will acknowledge the "Enter" command, but will stop at the structure, unable to move over it. Repair bays and tank bunkers accompany any vehicle, and none of them has Dock= set to the repair bay. That's because the repair bay has UnitRepair=yes and NumberImpassableRows=1, which flags it as an area passable by any VehicleType. In TS, NonVehicle=yes prevents a unit being repaired, while in RA2 it only prevents other vehicles repairing them, not the service depot. The Tank Bunker can hold units inside because it has Bunker=yes set. The AFC can hold only aircraft on it because of Helipad=yes, it doesn't need NumberImpassableRows=.

  Art coding
  By default, the units dock with the structure in it's exact center point. This can be changed by adding DockingOffsetN=X,Y,Z to the structure's art.ini coding. N is the number of the docking position, and will be used if all the docks with smaller N are used up. N starts at 0, not at 1. X, Y and Z are measured in leptons (1/256th of a cell). The center point of the structure is 0,0,0 and if you imagine a foundation of a 2x2 structure like so:

  -A-
  BXC
  -D-
  , the X increases from A to C, and Y - from A to B.

  To make it more clear, here's the Aircraft Command HQ:

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Dockoffsets.png)

  Here we can see the X axis, Y axis, and Z axis offsets in leptons from the center (0) of the building, where the red cells are not docks. As an example, from this image you can see that if you wanted to make Dock #5 where the topmost red cell is located, you would use DockingOffset4=-256,-128,0 where the center of that cell's X coordinate is -256 and center of the cell's Y coordinate is -128.

  Structure-specific info
  From testing, I've seen that:

  - A refinery is hardcoded to use only one cell for it's docking location, and it ignores both NumberOfDocks= and DockingOffset= and uses the center cell in the bottom-most row of the structure.
  - A repair bay can only have one dock, otherwise it'll crash.
  - A tank bunker is hardcoded to only one dock too, though I'm not sure if it can be not the exact center of the structure.
  - An AFC can use a lot of docks... a lot more than the usual 4. I've tested it more thoroughly and I've seen it support up to 16 docking locations. They'll work perfectly as long as you make sure all the DockingOffsets= are within the structure's Foundation=. If DockingOffset= points to outside the Foundation=, the aircraft will be produced on that offset as usual, but they'll refuse to land there after flying.

  Note: The rules' comment is

  ...since the Type-specific flags are listed below that section, this comment does theoretically not exclude InfantryTypes as users of Dock. The Guide only lists AircraftTypes and VehicleTypes. If anyone has made entirely sure that InfantryTypes cannot dock to buildings, please alter this page accordingly. (Just because a simple VehicleType-like connection does not work, it's not automatically impossible.)

  ## Undeployed vehicle facing

  Mind that if the game doesn't know which direction the VehicleType should be facing when it undeploys, it will undeploy the building without spawning the vehicle.

  The facing can be specified in the following ways:

  INI FlagFacingArtillary=yesNorth (↗)If this condition is not met, then check the following three:ICBMLauncher=yesEast (↘)SensorArray=yesTickTank=yesIf none of these three conditions are met, then face south (↙).Starting fromYuri's Revenge, the above four conditions no longer affect the direction, and instead, the following new statement is used to control it.DeployFacingAs set

  ## Notes

  The only difference between "undeploy" and "sell" is whether there is a movement destination.

  - If present, it creates an UndeploysInto vehicle;
  - if not, the building is sold and creates infantry remnants (granting engineers as appropriate).

  A critical PVP bug occurs when setting a movement destination before building sale completion, resulting in simultaneous acquisition of both vehicle and infantry.

  The game considers buildings with both UndeploysInto set and [Foundation=1x1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Foundation) as vehicles, endowing them with characteristics like no EVA announcement when captured.

  For [factory](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory) buildings, [ResourceDestination](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ResourceDestination) can suppress `EVA_NewRallyPointEstablished` when buildings undeploy into vehicles.

  If a building has UndeploysInto`=` and [Trainable=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Trainable), then when [Agent](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Agent) enters the place of [Factory=UnitType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory#BuildingType) factory, this building will also benefit.

  - In vanilla, [Cameo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cameo) will also be replaced by [AltCameo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AltCameo) just like Slave Miner in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), but [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) broke this behavior from version 0.1, and this issue was not fixed until [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) DevBuild#49.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  The program doesn't actually verify the [SpeedType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpeedType) and [MovementZone](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MovementZone) of UndeploysInto vehicles, only checking if not `none`. Therefore, movement destination settings solely depend on the original BuildingType's SpeedType. Corresponding [WaterBound=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WaterBound) will cause undeployed vehicles to fail setting correct movement targets.

  In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) selling buildings could be exploited to give free crew infantry or to create a virtual [MCV](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MCV) which could not be destroyed, the latter keeping the exploiting player alive forever.

  - When a re-deployable Construction Yard was sold, it could be ordered to move somewhere while packing up, and the sell order would be converted to a move order. The crew was still ejected from selling, and the player also kept the MCV. If the MCV could not be placed on the map, it would still be kept alive in memory, unable to be destroyed. If the building was destroyed while being sold, it would eject crew a second time.
  - Starting from version 0.A, [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) does no longer allow a sell order to be converted into a move order, and it will also not eject crew twice in case the building is destroyed while selling. Ares also makes sure the MCV is placed on the map, or it will be taken out of the game, no longer keeping players alive.

  ## On VehicleTypes

  The turret filename has to be the same as the object's, with the suffix `tur`, and be in [VXL](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VXL) format, with an accompanying [HVA](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/HVA). Should [UNIT] or have Image=UNIT (include Image=<none> and other) have Turret=yes set but no file with the name unittur exist, the game will crash.

  When a Shape-based vehicle has Turret=yes, it will additionally add a canvas size limit of 256x255 that applies to both the body and the turret.

  ## On BuildingTypes

  The turret filename is specified by [TurretAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnim), should be the same as on VehicleTypes, and its format is specified by [TurretAnimIsVoxel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnimIsVoxel). If the turret is in [SHP](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SHP) format, it should be defined in art(md).ini and listed in [Animations] in order to be loaded by the game. If the turret is in VXL format, this is not necessary.

  The spawned particle systems are attached to the owner object, and they are removed automatically when the owner is removed from the map.

  ## BehavesLike=Smoke

  A smoke particle system is created when a unit or structure is damaged and it enters yellow or red health (there has to be a change) and doesn't have a smoke particle system attached already. If the unit is below ground level, no particle system is created.

  The smoke particle system is removed when the object is repaired back into green health by either a service depot, a repair weapon or self-heal, or by upgrading or using click repair on buildings. Other logics might not remove the particle system and it will stay active until it expires.

  ## BehavesLike=Spark

  Particle systems are created with a probability of either [ConditionYellowSparkingProbability](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConditionYellowSparkingProbability) or [ConditionRedSparkingProbability](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConditionRedSparkingProbability), depending on the health of the unit.

You must also include DamageParticleSystems for those types in the map. If both the type section and the flag are not defined in the map file, damage sparks will be disabled. This is a hardcoded behavior and it is not possible to enable this setting manually.

  ## In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)

  Strangely, despite [TechnoTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoTypes) lacking [Sensors=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Sensors), they can still automatically attack units that have Cloakable=yes within range, as if there was no cloaking effect.

  Unlike in later games, TS (and [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm)) support Cloakable and [CloakingSpeed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CloakingSpeed) tags on buildings, without any problems.

  ## In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2)

  Earlier games did not have submarines, and so the cloaking effect only applied to terrestrial units, but in RA2 the cloaking system was repurposed for the Soviet Attack Sub. As such, the sound effects were updated to reflect their aquatic nature, with the splash effect defined by [CloakSound](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CloakSound) under [AudioVisual], played for both cloaking and decloaking.

  The [CloakStop=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CloakStop) tag was added to keep a unit like the Attack Sub cloaked when firing or in ambush position.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  In RA2, a fully cloaked unit (presumably submarine) might still reveal itself when retaliating (enabled by [CanRetaliate=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CanRetaliate)), or if the target of attack is sufficiently far away from it.

  Explicitly set Cloakable=no will be overridden if a unit gains the abilities through promotion.

  [Hovering](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpeedType)/Flying units do not support Cloakable=yes, however granting them cloakability via [VeteranAbilities](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VeteranAbilities) or [EliteAbilities](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EliteAbilities) is possible.

  - Ares has removed this hardcode, allowing the definition of the height for determining cloakable, and defaults it to the value of [HoverHeight](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/HoverHeight) located under [General], used by hovering units. Therefore by default, just having Ares enables the logic for hovering units, and requires additional configuration to return to vanilla game behaviour.

  - Use odd sequences for ground targets ([AG](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AG) and even sequences for aerial targets ([AA](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AA).
  - When the weapon in the current gear cannot attack the target, fall back to the previous gear.

  ## Notes

  As mentioned in the rules above, a vehicle with IsGattling can not fall back to a secondary weapon slot (even-numbered WeaponX slots) if primary one (odd-numbered) cannot fire at current target.

  Just like a normal [DeployFire](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployFire) occasionally fires the [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) weapon suddenly, in the Gattling system, this would mean occasionally using `Elite`Weapon1 suddenly.

  As long as the unit is firing, even if it cannot correctly use the Gatling rule to switch weapons, the fire [report](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Report) will be the report of the weapon determined by the Gatling sequence corresponding to the target position under the current timer, rather than the report of the weapon that is actually firing itself. For example, cannot switch weapons due to [WeaponXTurretLocked](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponXTurretLocked) or the situation of the simple deployer mentioned above.

  A building with [Bunker=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Bunker) will no longer be able to fire after a vehicle enters and leaves, even if it still normally displays the `Attack` cursor.

  This flag controls pip graphics rendering using special logic for [units](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoTypes) with [PipScale=ammo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PipScale#Ammo).

  If PipWrap is set to a positive [integer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Help:Values#Integers) greater than 0, that number of pips will be rendered. The most practical means of understanding which frame of pips2.shp is used for each pip at a given [Ammo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ammo) level is to simply see it in action.

  - 1Example
  - 2Recommended Configurations
  - 3Special values
  - 4See also

  ## Example

  The following table shows the relevant frames from pips2.shp in non-expanded [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2). In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) an additional frame used for occupancy pips was added in slot 12, so all frames pertaining to PipWrap are shifted one slot higher. Note that frame numbers start at 0 rather than 1, so frame 3 for example is actually the fourth frame.

  Frame Number1415161718Graphic
  To get an impression of how this logic works, assume that a unit has these three lines of code in its [Rules(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules.ini) entry:

  Ammo=12
  PipScale=Ammo
  PipWrap=3
  The pips will then be rendered as follows, depending on the unit's current ammo level.

  Current Ammo1211109876543210Pips
  It should then be fairly evident that the use of PipWrap allows each pip to represent more than just 0 or 1 points of ammo. Each pip represents n−14 ammo points, where n is equal to the frame of pips2.shp used to draw the pip.

  Frame Number1415161718nGraphic?Ammo Points01234n−14

  ## Recommended Configurations

  The previous example is only one of the many possible ways to configure PipWrap. However, not all possibilities yield desirable results. A basic rule of thumb is that PipWrap should be a factor of Ammo.

  It is also important to note that should the quotient of Ammo divided by PipWrap be a number greater than 4, pips2.shp will need to be modified using a tool such as [OS SHP Builder](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OS_SHP_Builder) to include the necessary frames beyond frame 18. If the [engine](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Engine) tries to draw a pip using a frame that doesn't exist—since the PipWrap scheme dictates that the pip should represent an amount of ammo points greater than 4—no graphic will be rendered for that pip.

  ## Special values

  If PipWrap=0, this special pip drawing logic will not be used. This is also the default behavior.

  - PrerequisiteOverride=GATECH

  A player can build the "THEMPARK" if they have satisfied one of the following conditions:

  - They own at least one Allied Ore Refinery and at least one building from the PrerequisitePower= group.
  - They own at least one Allied Battle Lab.

  The PrerequisiteOverride allows the player to build the "THEMPARK" without having to own an Ore Refinery or Power Plant, as long as they own a Battle Lab.

  Sight was using a lookup table almost like [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread), thus it was limited to a maximum value of `10`. It can be set to any positive integer, but setting it higher than `10` will have the same effect as setting it to `10`.

  - Ares increases this in version 0.6 and now larger values can be used.

  ## [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) Info

  For performance reasons, Sight values larger than `10` should be used judiciously. It is not designed for full map reveal.

  ## Notes

  When both DisguiseWhenStill and PermaDisguise are present, prioritize the use of PermaDisguise.

  For a vehicle, it obtains disguise graphics by attacking a [TerrainType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TerrainType) using a weapon with [MakesDisguise=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MakesDisguise) on its warhead. If the vehicle has [CanDisguise=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CanDisguise), it will immediately lose the disguise graphics upon movement.

  However, if the vehicle possesses DisguiseWhenStill=yes, it not only starts with default disguise graphics but can also maintain the previously acquired attack-based disguise graphics after completing movement without losing them.

  When unable to obtain disguise graphics through MakesDisguise=yes warheads, a unit with CanDisguise=yes can acquire graphics through two methods:

  - Using DisguiseWhenStill=yes to disguise as a randomly selected terrain type from the `[General]`→[DefaultMirageDisguises=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DefaultMirageDisguises) list when stationary.
  - Using [PermaDisguise=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PermaDisguise) to disguise as an infantry type based on its house's side ([AlliedDisguise](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedDisguise)/[SovietDisguise](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SovietDisguise)/[ThirdDisguise](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ThirdDisguise)).
  For vehicle types, this will use all frames of the disguise graphics as animations similar to how MakesDisguise=yes acquires tree graphics when CanDisguise=no. However, due to different sequence mechanisms, when moving:
  Tree graphics obtained via MakesDisguise=yes will play body and shadow frames from front to back.
  Infantry graphics obtained via PermaDisguise=yes will also play sequentially from front to back.
  Taking [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge)'s G.I. as an example, this manifests as first rotating counterclockwise through stand frames before transitioning to walk frames.

Speed
Cost="""
  Sets the base amount of credits needed to purchase this object, before any multipliers are applied (such as Country bonuses or the [Industrial Plant](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant)).
  The final cost (after any multipliers have been applied) is the amount of credits that will be deducted from the constructing player during the course of construction (when the unit is, say, 10% constructed, 10% of the final cost will have been deducted from the player. When the unit is 50% constructed, 50% of the final cost will have been deducted, and so on).

  Cost is sometimes used when calculating the [refund amount](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Soylent#Default) a player gets when selling or grinding a unit or building, depending on the circumstances (see [Soylent](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Soylent) for details).

  Cost also determines, in part, the amount of time the object will take to construct. [[General](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/General)]→[BuildSpeed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildSpeed) determines the time, in minutes, to construct 1000 credits' worth of an object, so an object with Cost=2000 will take ( 2 * [BuildSpeed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildSpeed) ) minutes to construct.
  Any multipliers to cost have no effect on construction time - construction time is always determined by the base Cost of an object.

  Cost also determines, in part, [the order objects' build icons will appear on the sidebar](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cameo_Sorting) - if there are two or more objects of the same [TechLevel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechLevel), the cheaper one(s) will appear earlier in the list.

  It is possible to set Cost to a negative value so that the player will actually receive credits during the object's construction. However, setting negative Cost values on multiplayer start units causes you to start with a very high number of units, because the number of starting units is based, in part, on their Cost value, and negative Cost values are converted to zero for this calculation.

  A [BuildingType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingType) that has a [FreeUnit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FreeUnit) with a higher Cost than the [BuildingType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingType)'s own Cost will actually cost the same as the [FreeUnit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FreeUnit) in-game, however the base cost is unchanged as far as other values, such as [Soylent](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Soylent) and build time, are concerned.

  ## Default

  Soylent doesn't have a default value as such (internally it is zero) but it is often said to be "half the cost". A unit's refund amount is actually calculated as follows:

  - If Soylent is non-zero then Soylent is used as the refund amount.
  - If Soylent is zero (i.e. not set) then the refund amount is taken to be:the unit's [Cost](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost) * (applicable [country-specific cost multiplier](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Country_Statistics#VeteranXXX_and_YYYZZZMult=) for that unit type) * (applicable [Industrial Plant](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant) multipliers for that unit type)[1].

  In the case of human players only (another example of the AI 'cheating'), this refund amount is then further multiplied by `[General]`→[RefundPercent=50%](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/RefundPercent)
  Relevant [pseudocode](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Pseudocode) is available at http://dc.strategy-x.com/src2/TechnoTypeClass/GetRefund.cpp.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  WhenSoylentis specified
  As indicated above, any unit that has a non-zero Soylent will use that value as its refund amount and ignore the normal refund logic. This means that any unit that has been discounted due to country-specific multipliers or [Industrial Plants](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant) will not reimburse the player by the correct amount when sold or sent to a [Grinder](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Grinding). In the unmodded game this is noticeable when grinding [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes). The game's designers decided that [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes) should have 100% refund rather than the default 50%, and the developers implemented this by simply setting all [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes)' Soylent to match the [Cost](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost) (rather than appropriately modifying the refund logic).

  The result of this is that, when a player owns both a [Grinder](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Grinding) and an [Industrial Plant](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant), the player can generate free money by immediately grinding any [VehicleType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleType) they build. One generally accepted work-around to this problem is to set the Soylent for all units to match the multiplier(s) offered by the [Industrial Plant](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant) and not to include any country-specific multipliers (this does decrease the amount of income Yuri players get from grinding enemy units, although some actually see this as an improvement to balance).

  WhenSoylentis not specified
  In this case, a potential exploit stems from the fact that the Industrial Plant bonus is applied at refund time - if you build units while you have a [Grinder](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Grinding) as well as [Industrial Plant(s)](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant), and then lose the Industrial Plant bonuses, you will be refunded half of the full cost by the Grinder, instead of half of the cost you purchased it for.
  Example:
  A unit usually costs 1000 credits.
  You have an Industrial Plant, and get the unit for 800 instead.
  Without `Soylent` on the unit, you should now get 400 credits back if you grind the unit.
  But if you lose your Industrial Plant, the Grinder will instead refund you half of the normal price of the unit - which is 1000/2 = 500 credits. 100 more than you were entitled to.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Note that since this multiplier is used at refund time, it will result in the same value as if you were purchasing that unit right now, not the value that was actually paid for the unit at its construction time, which results in another potential exploit.

  ## Trivia

  The name of the flag ("Soylent") is a reference to the 1973 film Soylent Green (IMDB/Wikipedia) starring Charlton Heston.
  Another reference to this can be found in-game during the [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) Allied mission 'Hollywood In Vain'. The captured civilians can be heard saying "Soylent green for Yuri" as they march to the Grinders.
"""
UnloadingClass="""
  Specifies the vehicle that this unit should turn into when performing a special function. The unit doesn't actually turn into another vehicle, though, and usually only the [Image](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Image) value is read. The default value 'none' means that the original unit's image will be used.

  ## Notes

  This logic only invokes the rendering method of the target VehicleType, meaning logical data such as [ROT=int](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROT) and [Turret=bool](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret) will remain unchanged.

  - Since Turret is associated with voxel rendering, the Turret of the target VehicleType determines whether the deployed image possesses a turret, but doesn't actually grant logical turret functionality.
  This implies that if the original unit has Turret=no while the hosting image unit has Turret=yes, disregarding other factors like [OmniFire](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OmniFire), even though the deployed unit visually gains a turret, it still needs to rotate its body toward the target to fire, with the turret synchronously following the rotation.

  This kind of logic that only replaces images can only use resource files of the same format. In other words, you cannot make a Voxel vehicle normally switch to using images from a Shape vehicle, and the same applies to Ares' [WaterImage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WaterImage).
"""
DeployingAnim
InitialAmmo="""
  This flag determines the ammunition supply of a [unit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoTypes), with [Ammo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ammo) set to a positive integer greater than 0, when it is created from the corresponding [Factory](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory). Values for InitialAmmo other than −1, which is a special case↓, result in a starting ammo supply of that number plus 1.

  Although usable ammo points are only measured in positive integers, it is possible to have a unit's current ammo be a negative number when it is created. If InitialAmmo is set to a negative integer less than −1, the unit will be created with no usable ammunition, and have an inversely proportional delay before it reloads enough to have a positive ammo supply.

  If InitialAmmo is set to a value greater than Ammo, then the unit will be created with its current ammo equal to InitialAmmo. However, if the unit has [PipScale=ammo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PipScale#Ammo), the pip display will innacurately represent an amount equal to Ammo until the unit depletes enough rounds so that its current ammo is no more than Ammo.

  Regardless, a unit can never reload its ammo by any means to an amount greater than Ammo, nor deplete its ammo to an amount less than 0.

  ## Special values

  - InitialAmmo=-1 results in the unit starting with full ammo. This is also the default behavior.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  - If an AircraftType starts without full ammo, it will be unable to reload it until it leaves its docking building and lands on it again.

  ## Special Values

  The only special value is -1, which means "unlimited ammo". This is also the default value for the flag.

  ## Standard Usage

  The ammo-system in RA2 and YR is mainly used for aircraft, and has therefore been re-coded to best fit this purpose; on one hand, this means that using ammo on non-[AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) is often buggy, in the sense that not all flags work or have the desired effect. This also means AircraftTypes require a declaration of Ammo= to work properly, and this number must be either -1 (for unlimited ammunition) or an integer greater than 0.

  In addition, Ammo can be used to limit the number of times a Tech Building can deliver it's effect, meaning that a structure with [Armory=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Armory) and Ammo=20 could only promote infantry 20 times before becoming useless. This only applies to structures with Armory=yes and/or [Hospital=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Hospital).

  ## The System in Detail

  The ammo and reloading system is controlled by several INI flags:

  - Ammo, which controls the maximum amount of rounds a unit can carry.
  - [InitialAmmo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InitialAmmo), which controls with how much ammo the unit will contain upon construction or spawning.
  - [Reload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Reload), which controls the time delay between reloading a certain amount of ammo; is no other specification given, it simply reloads to full ammo straight away.
  - [ReloadIncrement](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ReloadIncrement) can be used to speed up (or slow down) the rate at which a unit will reload with each successive PipWrap set.
  - [EmptyReload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EmptyReload), which controls the time delay before the first reload occurs when the unit is out of ammo.
  - [ManualReload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ManualReload), which controls whether this unit cannot reload itself, but has to [dock](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Dock) with a building; this is not set on aircraft because, unlike other TechnoTypes, it defaults to "yes" for them.

  Other Ammo-related flags on objects are.

  - [DamageReducesReadiness](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DamageReducesReadiness), which tells the game to reduce the amount of available ammo if the unit gets damaged
  - [PipScale](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PipScale), which in the form of PipScale=Ammo tells the game to show the amount of ammo a unit currently contains.

  And also important are:

  - [UnitReload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitReload), which gives buildings the ability to reload units with [ManualReload=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ManualReload)
  - [ReloadRate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ReloadRate), which is the flag in the general section controlling the number of minutes needed to restore one round of ammo on units docked to a building that reloads them.

  Example
  If a unit was set to

  Ammo=10
  PipScale=Ammo
  ReloadIncrement=30%
  Reload=450
  EmptyReload=150
  InitialAmmo=1
  it would start out with 1 round of ammo when it comes from it's factory. If it shot itself empty, it would take about 10 seconds (on medium game speed) until reloading started. It would then be reloaded by 3 rounds of ammo every 30 seconds, up until it's maximum amount of 10 rounds. This is all visible to the player, because the PipScale is drawn. Note that, in some cases, the unit does not necessarily need to be empty in order to reload itself.

  ## Ammo on Aircraft

  - Ammo and reloading on AircraftTypes works as seen in the game, using the manual system.
  - Automatic reloading on aircraft does not appear to work.

  After an aircraft kicks passengers, the next shot cannot be actually completed but still consumes Ammo. Therefore, each kick passenger actually uses 2 rounds of Ammo. For example, an aircraft with Ammo=4 and `3` passengers can only kick the first two in the first round, and can only kick the third after returning to the [Helipad](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Helipad) to replenish Ammo.

  - For the case with only `1` passenger, if you don't need to use [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF) to add a long time delay, you can consider adding [Burst=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Burst) to the weapon used for kick passengers to create one additional shot, and then use methods like [NoAmmoWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoAmmoWeapon) to switch to a weapon without additional shots to handle it.

  ## Ammo on Vehicles

  In Tiberian Sun
  Ammo works on [vehicles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes), but auto-reloading only works on units with [NoMovingFire=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoMovingFire) and only when they are standing still. Furthermore, the time it takes to reload one ammo pip is hardcoded to 450 [frames](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Frames).

  Manual reloading is possible via [ManualReload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ManualReload).

  In Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge
  Ammo and auto-reloading on VehicleTypes works perfectly, but manual reloading does not work without AI issues.

  ## Ammo on Infantry

  Ammo on Infantry does not work quite to design.
  You can give Infantry ammo, but they will not auto-reload until they are damaged. If your soldier runs out of ammo, they will have to be attacked by something in order to kick-start the reloading mechanism. However, no matter what other flags you set, it will just restore the infantry to full ammo.

  A partial solution to this problem is to use a "reloader" unit. I.e. a unit with a weapon that only inflicts one point of damage, uses the [FireOnce](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FireOnce), [AttackCursorOnFriendlies](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AttackCursorOnFriendlies) and [CloseRange](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CloseRange) tags in conjunction with a very low [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) value. The resulting effect is then that the unit moves up close to your unit, and then the "attacked" unit will reload as they take the negligible amount of damage from the reloader's "weapon".

  Also note that an infantry can only be reloaded when all of its ammo has been depleted, regardless of how much damage it takes. The reload mechanism will only fire once all of the unit's ammunition has been depleted.

  ## Ammo on Buildings

  In Red Alert and Tiberian Sun
  Buildings with a [weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) and Ammo fire all shots immediately, ignoring [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF) between shots. Once all ammo has been expended, the building will fully reload instantly, however the building will wait for the duration of the weapon's [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF) before firing again. [Reload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Reload), if specified, is ignored.

  In Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge
  Ammo on buildings is rather useless. While it does work, and even reloads, it simply reloads to full ammo as soon as it is out of rounds, meaning that it makes no difference if ammo is defined or not. Your structure won't even stop shooting while reloading.
  In addition, if a building with ammo is used to force-fire somewhere, the [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF) will be ignored, turning the structure's armament into a rapidly firing weapon.

  Ammo on Tech Buildings
  Tech Buildings are a special case for ammunition on structures. More specifically, this involves Tech Buildings that have the tag Armory=yes or Hospital=yes. The Ammo tag will then have a different function if one of these tags are present. In this instance, the Ammo tag will control the amount of uses the Tech Building has.

  For example, you have a Tech Building with Armory=yes and Ammo=25. The structure will be able to promote infantry 25 times, and then can no longer promote any more infantry.

  The EXE file contains a check for when a structure's ammo is depleted. Firstly, the game looks to see if the building has Armory=yes or Hospital=yes, if not its ammo is then simply reset to full.

  If you were to give a base defense structre a weapon along with either Armory=yes or Hospital=yes, the structure will empty its clip and not do anything again.

  Also note that Ammo is shared with between the structure's weapon, and any applicable Tech Building function. For example, if you have Ammo=5 on a structure with Armory=yes and a [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) weapon, you could perform 5 infantry promotions, or fire 5 rounds, or any combination of the two that totals up to 5.

  ## Fixes in Ares

  Version 0.1 of Ares fixes the Ammo logic for InfantryTypes and BuildingTypes; on the latter, Ammo is only reloaded if neither Armory nor Hospital=yes. No change was made on VehicleTypes and AircraftTypes (latter are still hardcoded to require manual reloading).

  ## Notes

  The `IFVMode` is floored at zero, while the WeaponX is floored at one, meaning that IFVMode=0 (the default mode of the IFV when empty, as well as the default for this flag) actually calls for `Weapon1`, IFVMode=1 calls for `Weapon2`, etc.
  There is no (reasonable) upwards limit on IFV modes that can be created on the IFV, however, the number of weapons modes that will also cause the IFV to swap turrets is limited by the 'swapping factors' (See [YTurretWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=YTurretWeapon&action=edit&redlink=1) and [YTurretIndex](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=YTurretIndex&action=edit&redlink=1)), which are hard-coded into the game and number 13 in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and 17 in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge).

  - In version `0.E`, [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) extended this logic to remove the 18-mode(include 0) limitation.

  ## Notes

  When a unit gets ordered to attack an airborne target, it will strive to move into the [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) value of its anti-air weapon, and stay there while attacking. Adding AirRangeBonus doesn't affect this behavior, but as it increases the weapon's effective firing range, it actually makes slow moving anti-air units more effective against targets that are able to escape from them (especially if they have [OpportunityFire=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpportunityFire)), since they will automatically move in to cover a larger area.

  ## In Tiberian Sun

  Though Reload appears in [rules.ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules.ini), it does not exist in the game executable, therefore the flag is never parsed. Instead, the game has a hardcoded reload rate of 450 [frames](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Frames).

  ## In Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge

  By setting [EmptyReload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EmptyReload) to an integer other than Reload or −1, this delay can be modified for reloading the first round of ammunition when the unit is empty.

  On units that have [PipWrap](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PipWrap) set to a positive integer greater than 0, [ReloadIncrement](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ReloadIncrement) can be used to speed up or slow down the rate at which they reload.

  If PipWrap is set to a positive integer greater than 0, ReloadIncrement can be used to speed up (or slow down if a negative value is used) the rate at which a unit will reload with each successive PipWrap tier.

  ## Notes

  The exact reloading time can be calculated using the following formula[2]:

  "total reload frames" = Reload + ( ReloadIncrement * ( "current ammo" / PipWrap )^2 )

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ As opposed to manually; see [ManualReload](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ManualReload).
  - ↑ The division of "unit's current ammo" into PipWrap is integer division, which means that any decimal places will be knocked off; i.e. 5/2 = 2, not 2.5.

However, if the Gunner=yes vehicle is also [OpenTopped=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpenTopped), the infantry with the Temporal weapon inside is still expected to fire on its own, but because it doesn’t have the Temporal device any more, the game crashes.

Naval="""
  If set to yes, this flag forces a [Factory](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory)=yes building to only build VehicleTypes with a corresponding Naval=yes flag set. This flag serves as the only real logical distinction between a land-based vehicle factory and a naval-based ship factory.

  ## On [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes)

  If set to yes, determines that this vehicle can only be built by a factory with Naval=yes set.

  Additionally, Naval=yes is used to designate what is considered a "naval" target for [NavalTargeting](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NavalTargeting) logic.

  ## NCO Bug Warning

  Copied From [EVA_NewConstructionOptions](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EVA_NewConstructionOptions):

  The cause of the NCO bug is, indirectly, due to the developers' decision to treat Naval and land-based vehicles as members of the same VehicleType class, rather than creating a separate class. Shipyards are therefore classed as Factory=VehicleType, just like War Factories. This means the game will determine that you can build the land-based vehicles when you don't have a War Factory but do have a Shipyard, and vice versa for Naval vehicles.

  The result of this is that, unless you set all ground vehicles to have a [Prerequisite](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Prerequisite) of at least one of the War Factories and set all Naval units to have a [Prerequisite](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Prerequisite) of at least one of the Shipyards, you'll get the NCO bug when you own one of the factories but not the other. You can add other prerequisites as well if you like, but all units must include a [Prerequisite](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Prerequisite) of a factory of the appropriate kind.

  [PrerequisiteOverride](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PrerequisiteOverride) makes this difficult, since a satisfied [PrerequisiteOverride](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PrerequisiteOverride) causes [Prerequisite](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Prerequisite) to be ignored. If you set [PrerequisiteOverride](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PrerequisiteOverride) to something other than the appropriate factory, you'll get the bug. So it's best to stay away from this tag where possible.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Naval=yes also prevents this BuildingType from being placed on non-Water tiles, or being deployed from a vehicle on non-Water tiles, regardless of the value of [WaterBound](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WaterBound).
"""
Repairable="""
  Define whether this building can be repaired.

  This includes granting the building a continuous repair effect by using the `Repair` cursor until it is fully healed, as well as using infantry with [Engineer=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Engineer) to enter and instantly repair it to full health.

  ## Notes

  When using the continuous repair effect, the repair interval is determined by `[General]`→[RepairRate=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/RepairRate), and the amount of health restored per repair is determined by `[General]`→[RepairStep=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/RepairStep).

  It also has a sub-flag named [ClickRepairable](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ClickRepairable), used when Repairable=yes to individually disable the repair method of `Repair` cursor, so that buildings can only be repaired by engineers.

  - But as a sub-flag, it cannot conversely allow this repair method when Repairable=no.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This directly controls whether engineers can enter the building. If set to no, then even buildings belonging to other houses that can be [captured](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Capturable) cannot be entered normally.

  The wrench animation appearing when a building is being repaired could give away building positions to enemies as it was visible for everyone even if the structure was cloaked.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.8 and buildings will not show the repair animation while cloaked. Observers will still see the wrench, though.

  The wrench animation even played when a building being repaired was targeted by a temporal weapon, even though no repairs would take place during this time and the health remains the same while being warped out.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.8 and the repair wrench will not be shown in this situation.

  ## References

  By default, all repairing is stopped once a player no longer has enough credits to afford it. After gaining some credits, the buildings have to be ordered to repair again. Ares 0.D has changed this behavior. Refer to Ares documentation.

  For buildings that can be entered and repaired, if they are damaged, engineers will prioritize repair over entering. Phobos DevBuild#48 has changed this behavior; see the Phobos documentation for details.

ROT="""
  Determines the Rate Of Turn of this object and/or its turret, if applicable. Bigger number = faster turn.

  Infantry always turn instantly, vehicles and buildings turn instantly when ROT=0, and aircraft will fly in a straight line when ROT=0.

  For [Red Alert](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert) ROT=0 This will make [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes) unable to move. Can only attack and turn the turret slowly.

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:ROT%3D0_(Ra1).gif)

  On Projectiles
  A non-zero value means this projectile can home-in on its target. A value of 0 disables homing behavior and leaves the projectile to fly like [Arcing](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Arcing).

  ## Special Cases

  ROT=0
  ROT=0 is not actually an intentional way of working for any type; it just tells the game that this projectile does not belong to the ROT type. If this projectile is not of the Arcing, [Inviso](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Inviso) or [Vertical](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical) type at the same time, it will use a default behavior. This behavior is equivalent to a faulty Arcing[1], but when the distance to the target exceeds `8` cells, it will always hit at `2/3` of the path. In GearZero, this was programmatically changed to a straight-line trajectory. However, apart from this, the performance of this default behavior is always awkward, and its trajectory is clearly not straight but curved. If you want to achieve a straight trajectory, you should use the Straight trajectory provided by Phobos. Refer to Phobos documentation.

  ROT=1
  A projectile with a ROT=1 will follow what appears to be a straight line to its target (seen on the Cyborg Commando in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)). Actually, at extended ranges and low speeds, even projectiles with ROT=1 will adjust their trajectory to accomodate for changes in the target's position, but this is not usually visible. However, projectiles with ROT=1 will have no height deviation from their firing point, unlike missiles with higher ROT, which will fly upwards to hit the target in an arc.

  - Setting ROT=1 appears to make the projectile default to a high acceleration, meaning that it will be fired at a low speed and accelerate as it moves towards its target, though modifying the `Acceleration` tag can prevent this in order to generate a smoother flight.
  - Because the turning speed is too slow, projectiles with ROT=1 are known to act strangely when fired at certain angles or distances. They will sometimes "overshoot" their target and fly on past the map boundaries, but re-enter the map later, hitting their target. Other unusual behaviour has been observed regarding flight characteristics, especially when an ROT=1 is coupled with [AA=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AA), this also applies in any case where the ROT/Speed ratio is small. The most obscure effects are obtained by firing an projectile with an ROT of 1 from aircraft, which will give an extreme form of the "Circling Missile bug".

  ## Notes

  When used together with Arcing=yes, it causes the unit to be unable to fire properly. Instead, it continuously plays the [FireUp](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FireUp) sequence by cycling through each round one after another, and ignoring the rearm interval defined by [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF).

  Regardless of whether it has AA=yes or not, as long as the target tracked by the projectile is destroyed in mid-air, the projectile will fly to the altitude specified by `[General]`→[MissileSafetyAltitude=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MissileSafetyAltitude) and then detonate.

  This type of projectile is sensitive to speed; too low a speed may cause it to ascend vertically after firing and then detonate, and a lower speed may result in various strange trajectories.

  When using this type of projectile, some flags can function; see the #See Also section.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  When an aircraft uses a projectile with ROT`< 2` and Inviso=no, it will enter Strafing mode. In this situation, it cannot attack aerial targets.

  - Although you can make it fire by first strafing the ground and then changing the target to an aerial object...
  - This bug has been fixed in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#43.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Since AircraftTypes attach their own three-dimensional velocity to the projectile when firing, when launched by aircrafts, ROT=0 and Arcing=yes are completely identical in terms of trajectory.

Passengers="""
  This tag defines the transport units capacity, and is required for all transports. A transport vehicle is defined by the [Category=Transport](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Category) tag.

  Functionality difference between games:

  - RA/CS/AM

  - TS/FS/RA2/YR

  Caveat: Certain objects have additional hardcoded conditions preventing some objects from entering others.

  Aircraft with passengers have their maximum [vertical speed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlightLevel) halved during takeoff, and there is a dedicated transport behavior that causes this type of aircraft to always attempt to return to an [airport](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Helipad) or (if no airport is available, find a) allies unit nearby to land when idle. However, this behavior sometimes hinders the aircraft from landing at the airport. Of course, you can use [SlowdownDistance=0](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SlowdownDistance) to avoid this behavior to some extent.

  In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), VehicleTypes cannot be used as passengers. This is allowed starting from [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), but if the target it is entering is an AircraftTypes, then it will get stuck on the `Enter` mission after approaching and never complete entering. If `Enter` commands are continuously issued at this time, it may cause the vehicles to turn towards the position of the transport aircraft and immediately crash.

  ## On BuildingTypes

  In YR, this tag determines the amount of objects allowed inside if this structure has [InfantryAbsorb=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryAbsorb) or [UnitAbsorb=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitAbsorb).

  Unlike on transports, each object takes up exactly one slot.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If an aircraft creates initial passengers through the InitialPayload logic introduced by [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) (normally, passengers entering from external sources do not cause this issue), then even if it parachutes all passengers out through firing, it still cannot fire weapons. It will still believe that it has passengers that have not been completely parachuted out. [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) allows setting whether weapon firing parachutes passengers or not through `[Weapon]`→KickOutPassengers= (boolean). If set to no, such an aircraft can fire normally.

  If other PipScale`=` values are used for transport units, unforeseen situations may occur. For example, if PipScale=Ammo is used, then passenger pips will be drawn based on the maximum Ammo count, even though passengers actually cannot use that many.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 2.0.

  Since Ares 0.2, due to an implementation issue in the `EjectRandomly` function, non-InfantryTypes passengers escaping from a destroyed transport unit also use the position selection rules for InfantryTypes, causing them to deviate from the cell center.

Non homing projectiles don't seem to be affected.

  ## Notes

  In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), this actually works equally well for projectiles launched by units.

  ## Target Laser Tutorials

  Here you will find a selection of tutorials relating creating a targeting laser effect.

  Improved Targeting Lasers (by Tratos)
  This will show you how to make very effective target lasers for your units.

  This tutorial is very very easy but has good results. Firstly you need to find the unit you want to give a target laser too. For the purpose of this tutorial i will be reffering to the [GGI].

  Secondly, ensure that your chosen unit does not have the tag
  TargetLaser=
  and if it does ensure that the value is no. This tag gives a 'laser' that is essentially just a red line drawn between the unit and its target and looks rubbish.

  Next, choose the weapon you want to apply the target laser to, in the case of the GGI i chose the [MissileLauncher] weapon to give the GGI laser guided missiles. Find the chosen weapon in [rules](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules).ini and add the following code to the end of its stats:

  [LaserInnerColor=*,*,*](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserInnerColor)
  [LaserDuration=**](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserDuration)
  [IsLaser=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsLaser)

  Change the *'s to the values you desire. For the colours these will be in RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format (a good red colour is 255,10,10). For the laser duration the value determines the time the laser effect is visible for, a good value is 15-20.

  This will draw a laser between the unit and the target when the weapon is fired. The good thing is that the normal [projectile](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Projectile) (in this case the missile) is also still drawn and the damage only happens when that projectile hits. This gives the effect of a small laser aiming at the target before the missile is fired giving the impression of laser guided missiles. This works best for weapons with a viewable [projectile](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Projectile). For weapons with invisible [projectiles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Projectile) (or [projectiles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Projectile) with a speed of 100) it will just look like the unit is firing a laser.

  You can also add the tags:

  [LaserOuterColor=*,*,*](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserOuterColor)
  [LaserOuterSpread=*,*,*](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserOuterSpread)

  And these will add a slight glow to the laser, personally i prefer it without these tags but you may not. The values are done in the same way as the InnerColor (RGB format).

  This effect is great for elite weapons to add a visual identifier that the unit is Elite apart from the chevrons and to mark the weapon apart from regular versions.

  ## Notes

  - Hunter Seekers will never fire their weapons because the target is always considered out of [range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range), and they will not turn around either. Although their [turret](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret) will still face the target (if any), and they will still approach the target unit when the distance to the target exceeds their weapon's range.
  This will not disable the function of [C4=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/C4).

  - If there is no HunterSeeker=yes which causes the damage dealt by this unit to the target also affects itself and preventing this unit from firing, then it will initially use Hunter Seeker behavior to select a target across the entire map, approach it, and continue firing after entering weapon range, rather than only dealing damage when the distance to the target reaches the value in centimeters specified by HunterSeekerDetonateProximity.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), the Hunter-Seeker Droid effectively ensures the destruction of its target by setting a huge value for the Damage of its weapon named `[SuicideBomb]` to ensure the destruction of the target, while simultaneously ensuring its own destruction through this property granted by HunterSeeker=yes, thereby accomplishing the so-called 'Suicide'.
  - ↑ As mentioned in the first point, the primary weapon is not actually fired; only its [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) and [Warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead) are used to deliver the damage.

  This OmniCrusher should best have the tag [OmniCrushResistant=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OmniCrushResistant) set, to prevent two of the same type trying to crush each other.

  In fact, the reason why it can ignore [Crushable=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Crushable) is because it only follows the setting of [OmniCrushResistant=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OmniCrushResistant), rather than having a "higher-level crush"

BalloonHover="""
  Is used on units with [Locomotor=Jumpjet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) set and specifies that they will never land by default.

  ## Notes

  Such vehicles and aircraft will always attempt to move directly above their target when attacking, even though their weapon's Range is already sufficient to engage the enemy. This behavior was implemented for the Kirov Airship in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2).

  - In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), as long as BalloonHover=true, the above behavior will occur.
  - In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), must BalloonHover=true and the Projectile of the Weapon being used must have [Vertical=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical).

  In theory, mis-casing [JumpJetAccel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpJetAccel) can be used as a 'fix' for the problem with BallonHover-ers always willing to occupy the same cell as the target.

  In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), a new hover mode was introduced to achieve an effect similar to BalloonHover=yes, see #See Also.

  A useful piece of knowledge is: Air units that fly in from outside the map (including aircraft using [Locomotor={B7B49766-E576-11d3-9BD9-00104B972FE8}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Rocket) (Rocket)) are usually not actively attacked by other units, but adding BalloonHover=yes to them can fix this bug.

  Another useful piece of knowledge is: the feature of attempting to move directly above the target can prevent vehicles with [DeployToFire=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployToFire) from stopping immediately and performing the deploy behavior upon reaching a distance to the target that is only the weapon's [Range=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) set value. This is a significant improvement for [MCVs](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MCV) that want to use weapons to set a deploy position after moving; otherwise, they would actually start deploying before reaching the target cell even if the Range is small enough.

  When applied to aircraft, this prevents them from rotating beyond `90` degrees in the vertical plane during a crash; that is, the vertical component of the aircraft's own upward vector remains positive, meaning the top of the aircraft never faces downward.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This will interrupt the effect of [CloakStop](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CloakStop).

  This will prohibit units from performing the `Enter` action on buildings with flags such as [DockUnload=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DockUnload), [UnitRepair=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitRepair), [Helipad=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Helipad), etc.

  - When applied to [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) that must dock at a helipad due to [AirportBound=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirportBound), it will cause them to crash immediately after completing or abandoning other tasks – just as if all helipads they could return to had been destroyed.
  - For [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes), this will also prevent them from entering transport units and cause the cursor to display in the `NoEnter` style.

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:BalloonHover%3Dyes_on_Intruder.gif)

  Units with [Locomotor=Jumpjet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) and BalloonHover=yes must be produced from a [Factory](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory) with an [ExitCoord](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ExitCoord) lower than its [JumpjetHeight](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpjetHeight), otherwise they will get stuck at the factory entrance.

  This will also affect the pathfinding after group-selecting units and issuing a `Move` command. Specifically, this will cause them all to move to the same type of land. For example, clicking on an elevated bridge over water will cause them all to set their target to the bridge. This is also manifested when clicking on cells next to cliffs and buildings.

  ## MYTH

  In some old materials, there is the following saying:

  This also has the additional effect of using the Balloon Hover Alternate Characteristics on the unit.

  However, the flags under the mentioned section do not exist in `gamemd.exe`. They are likely remnants from [Westwood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Westwood)'s development phase of [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), where they planned to add a Wobble effect identical to [Locomotor={4A582742-9839-11d1-B709-00A024DDAFD1}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Hover) (Hover) for units using BalloonHover=yes. But in the end, they actually used [JumpjetWobbles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpjetWobbles) and [JumpjetDeviation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpjetDeviation), which correspond to [WobblesPerSecond](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WobblesPerSecond) and [WobbleDeviation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WobbleDeviation) introduced in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) for units with [Locomotor={92612C46-F71F-11d1-AC9F-006008055BB5}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Jumpjet) (Jumpjet).

  **On Spawned Missile**:

  If set to yes, this means that the kills scored by the spawned object count towards the veterancy of the spawning object and immune to the death of the object that spawned it.

  - For example, the V3 Launcher can become Veteran or Elite by the kills done by the V3 Rockets it spawns. Even if the V3 Launcher is destroyed, the V3 Rocket will not die synchronously like Hornet does when the Aircraft Carrier that created it is destroyed.

  Another apparent function is that no more instances of an object with MissileSpawn=yes are spawned once the spawning object is no longer itself attacking. Correspondingly, if the spawnees have not all left the launcher, then the launcher unit will not be able to obtain cursors such as `Move`[1] and `AttackOutOfRange`[2].

  - For example, an Aircraft Carrier will spawn fighters at a target even when having been ordered to move, as long as the target is within range, opposed to the V3 Launcher, which stops spawning when moving.

  This can prevent warheads that use [IsLocomotor=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsLocomotor) from targeting this techno.

  - This is different from setting a [Size](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Size) larger than [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage), which only affects the impact effect but does not prevent targeting.

  If the TechnoType with this flag also has [Naval=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Naval)[1] set, it uses the Squid-like behaviour for Parasite instead of Terror Drone-like

  - For example, parasiting an infantry unit will not kill the target instantly, but instead will deal damage specified by the `[Weapons]`→[Damage=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) attribute to the target every 40 frames(It's equivalent to hardcoding the value of `[Weapons]`→[ROF=link](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF)), and will force the selection of an effect animation from the list specified by `[CombatDamage]`→[SplashList=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SplashList) when attacking.
  - At the same time, it also disables the animations in the `[Weapons]`→[Anim=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Anim) list. It uses an Animation object named `[SQDG]` for the firing and entangling effects, as well as the shaking effect when entangled. The frame sequence is hardcoded to correspond with specific behaviors, and the rules for the frame sequence can be found at here.
  - Additionally, this will enable the `[Warhead]`→[Culling=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Culling)[2] and `[Warhead]`→[Paralyzes=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Paralyzes) flags to take effect and prohibit attacking land targets (overriding [LandTargeting](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTargeting) and [NavalTargeting](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NavalTargeting)).
  - If it is dragged ashore[3] by the target unit, it will be immediately ejected to an adjacent water cell.

  If another TechnoType targeting this object has [NavalTargeting=3](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NavalTargeting)(ORGANIC_SECONDARY) and this object is in the water, makes the attacker use the Secondary weapon for attacking it.

  A TechnoType with this flag set and both [Underwater=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Underwater) and [SelfHealing=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SelfHealing) set uses its [GuardRange](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GuardRange) instead of the larger of its two first weapons' [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range)s for scanning for targets.

  Makes this VehicleType be affected by the Tech Hospital's Auto-Heal instead of Tech Machine Shop's Auto-Repair.

  - Applies the Infantry styled Auto-Heal pip (red cross) to this VehicleType if possible.

  ## With [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares)

  If used as a vehicle, this vehicle will no longer be considered a vehicle for Carryall logic, meaning it cannot be used a [Carryall](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Carryall).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) version 1.000, when units entangled by a Squid-style parasite are moved by a warhead with IsLocomotor=yes, the parasite is dragged along and gets destroyed upon reaching land.

  - Starting from version 1.001, when units are affected by a warhead with IsLocomotor=yes, the parasite stops its parasitic behavior and becomes an independent unit again.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Before version 1.001 of [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), the target also needed to have the setting [Naval=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Naval); otherwise, it would normally use the animations set in `[Weapons]`→[Anim=(list of animations)](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Anim), just like how the giant squid attacks the Robot Tank in version 1.000 of [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge).
  - ↑ [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) has allowed Culling to operate independently of the above logic since version 3.0.
  - ↑ The reason for the possibility of being dragged ashore can be seen in the notes for [Paralyzes#Bugs](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Paralyzes#Bugs).

  This section, along with `[Easy]` and `[Difficult]`, controls the impact the selected difficulty has on the players.

  Described here are the multipliers flags of `[Easy]`, `[Normal]` and `[Difficult]` sections. Some only affect AI players, others affect both AI and human players.

  You may edit multipliers using the following tags:

  Airspeed=(float);This is the speed multiplier for all aerial units (afaik not including jumpjets)Armor=(float);This is the multiplier to unit and building armor strengthBuildSlowdown=(bool);This tag controls whether the computer builds slower than the human playerCost=(float);This is the multiplier to unit and building costFirePower=(float);This is the multiplier to all weapons' firepowerGroundspeed=(float);This is the speed multiplier for all ground unitsROF=(float);This is the multiplier to all weapons' rate of fire
  These tags only affect the computer player(s):

  ContentScan=(bool);This controls whether the AI should consider the contents of a transport when choosing a targetRepairDelay=(float);This controls the time in minutes between starting building repairBuildDelay=(float);This controls the time in minutes between starting constructionDestroyWalls=(bool);This controls whether the AI should scan for and destroy enemy walls

  ## How it works

  Game uses three difficulty settings allowing the player to choose from easy, normal or difficult level of difficulties. Various flags use three values to differentiate the difficulty levels like in [AIHateDelays](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AIHateDelays) or [TotalAITeamCap](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TotalAITeamCap). Skirmish difficulty selection are also affected by the three valued flags in [rules(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules.ini) like [MultiplayerAICM](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MultiplayerAICM) and `[AITriggerTypes]` in [ai(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ai.ini).

  Difficulty Settings as such refers to the three sections of `[Easy]`, `[Normal]` and `[Difficult]`. Difficult level is also known as brutal or hard.

  InTiberian Sun&Firestorm
  - If the player selects to play at easy difficulty level, then the game will use values from `[Easy]` section for the player and computer/AI gets values from `[Difficult]` section.
  - If the player select to play at medium/normal level, then both the player and computer/AI will use values from `[Normal]` section.
  - If the player selects to play at hard difficulty level, then the game will use values from `[Difficult]` section for the player and computer/AI gets values from `[Easy]` section.

  **In skirmish/multiplay**:

  Human player always get the values from `[Normal]` difficulty section.

  - AI on hard/brutal gets the values from `[Easy]` section.
  - AI set on easy difficulty gets the values from `[Difficult]` section.
  - AI on normal/medium difficulty setting gets its values from `[Normal]` section.

  - Fields of RepairDelay, BuildDelay, DestroyWalls and ContentScan only affects the computer player.

  InRed Alert 2&Yuri's Revenge
  For the flags which are functional, the section values are used in the same way as in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) described above for single player missions and skirmish/multiplayer.

  - Armor, Cost, Airspeed, Groundspeed, BuildSlowdown, BuildDelay and ContentScan are obsolete.
  - FirePower and ROF works for both human and AI players.
  - RepairDelay and BuildTime are used by AI players only.

  A new system with fields like [CostBuildingsMult](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CostBuildingsMult) is put in place for [Country Statistics](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Countries#VeteranXXX_and_YYYZZZMult=) but not for Difficulty Settings.

  ## Notes

  Because the FLH of turret units is based on the center of the turret, this also affects the rotation center of FLH in the horizontal direction.

  Only BuildingTypes that follow [Default naming convention](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BarrelAnimIsVoxel#Overview_of_Scenarios_under_Different_Naming_Rules) can normally use TurretOffset.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Because the FLH of BuildingTypes uses a separate system, this function has only graphical effects on them.

  Just as described above, this does not apply to shape-based units.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#37.

  In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), FLH did not correctly base on the turret position offset, but only superimposed the TurretOffset value onto the F direction and continued to use the body center as the rotation axis. In other words, at that time, this function only acted on graphical effects.

  PrimaryFireFLH=256,0,0
  TurretOffset=512

  ## [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Info

  Starting from Phobos Build#7, the TurretOffset flag for voxel turreted TechnoTypes now supports FLH (forward, lateral, height) values such as TurretOffset=F,L or TurretOffset=F,L,H, which means the turret location can now be adjusted in all three axes.

Normalized="""
  If set, this animation's speed will be modified depending on your Game Speed setting to make it play at the same perceived speed.

  Animation durations are determined at the animation's creation time:

  - First, the time in frames it will take to finish (let's call it `T`) is equal to the animation's [Rate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rate) setting.
  - If the animation has a valid [RandomRate=x,y](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/RandomRate) specified, `T` is set to a random number between `x` and `y`.
  - If Normalized=yes is set on this animation, `T` is recalculated according to a formula:
  If `T` is larger than 5 (the most common case), it's recalculated to equal `(8 *T/ Game Speed)` (on the scale of 1 through 6).
  If it is between 1 and 4 frames inclusive, the game applies hardcoded multipliers instead, which are not clear at this time.

DisableVoxelCache="""
  Normally the game will create a sprite sheet (renderings) of all the necessary draw angles of a voxel, turning what is notionally a 3D object into 2D for faster drawing. This tag tells the game never to save the rendered result of the voxel in any animation state or rotation, thus there is no cache to speed up drawing it on the next frame.

  The developers' original intention seems to have been to reduce memory consumption caused by caching animated voxels. However, it should be noted that disabling voxel caching can cause rather drastic performance drop with large animated voxels, when a substantial amount of them are drawn on screen at once, as they have to be constantly re-rendered without being able use faster cached data.

  Unlike in case of [DisableShadowCache](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DisableShadowCache), where a shadow might significantly diverge from its animated state, not disabling the voxel caching generally will not result in any visual problems.
"""
DisableShadowCache="""
  This tag tells the game whether the shadow cast by this object should be cached or not. Disabling the cache makes the game render a separate shadow for each frame of the object's hva animation (as opposed to using only shadows of the first frame for all frames of the animation). This effectively fixes any holes created in the shadow by moving sections of the voxel, and prevents the shadow from appearing on a jumpjet that lands on the ground.

  ## Description

  F=forward axis, L=lateral axis, H=vertical axis. Check [FLH](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FLH).

  Units are in leptons, which are 256 per cell boundary, or 128 from center to edge. The vertical leptons are halved in relative offset, just as the artwork for a cell is half as tall as it is wide, thus 128 equals a height of 1 in terrain elevation.

  Positive values are forward, right; up, negative values are rearward, left, down.

  ## Even-Numbered Bursts

  Weapons with an even number [Burst](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Burst) value (e.g. 2) will consider a non-zero value for L as the mirror twin offset for the subsequent even numbered bullet/projectile. In this way a twin barrelled tank (e.g. Apocalypse) or twin pod rocket launcher (e.g. IFV) can shoot from both sides.

  ## Voxel Barrel Pivot

  If the object has an [arcing](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Arcing) primary weapon and a [voxel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Voxel) barrel, PrimaryFireFLH also affects the barrel pivot offset. In order to move the firing offset to the tip of the barrel without moving the pivot, use [PBarrelLength](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PBarrelLength).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  When using multiple bursts, the [muzzle flash animation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Anim) is played on the opposite lateral offset. This means the animation will play on one offset while the projectile flies out of the other.

  Passengers in a transport vehicle with [OpenTopped=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpenTopped) will mirror their FLH based on the [Burst](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Burst) sequence number of the transport vehicle's weapon.

  In fact, this does not directly specify [FLH](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FLH) coordinates, but by adding an additional step on top of the conventional scenario, before processing the L flip of even-numbered coordinates, it first calculates the odd-numbered coordinates after superimposing SecondSpawnOffset.

MovementZone="""
  MovementZone says where the unit is allowed to go and helps the [AI](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AI) pathfinding routines. The possible values it takes are:

  MovementZoneAvailable inDescriptionNoneNoneNormalWhen pathfinding, considers clear ground passable. Assumes it can destroy terrain obstacles and crush infantry.CrusherWhen pathfinding, only clear ground is considered passable. Also assumes that it can crush infantry, but is not armed.[1]Units with Subterranean [Locomotor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) and Crusher MovementZone will only dig in if there are 11 tiles between unit destination. Those tiles were Clear tiles.
  DestroyerWhen pathfinding, considers ground passable. Can destroy terrain obstacles and crush infantry obstacles.AmphibiousDestroyerSame asAmphibiousCrusher, additionally can destroy terrain obstacles. In RA2 this is tied to being an amphibious infantry.AmphibiousCrusherWhen pathfinding, the unit will consider both ground and water as passable. In addition, it will assume that it is capable of crushing infantry, but is unarmed.[1]AmphibiousWhen pathfinding, the unit will consider both ground and water as passable.This is the only MovementZone that allows amphibious units, like Hover Craft and Robot Tanks or even the TS GDI APC, to dock with all [UnitRepair=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitRepair) buildings for repairs, regardless if it's land-based Service Depot or a water-based Naval Yard.
  Otherwise the unit will stick with land-based OR water-based, never both.
  Subterrannean[2]When pathfinding, considers clear ground passable. When destination is too far away for surface travel, or there is an obstacle in the way, unit will dig underground. In other cases, when subterranean travel is not possible, or surface travel is quicker, acts like a unit withMovementZone=CrusherorMovementZone=Destroyer.This MovementZone is what allows units with Subterranean [Locomotor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) to dig in if target location and/or origin location can't be dug into courtesy of [AllowBurrowing=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AllowBurrowing) on the [TileSets](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TileSets) and make unit look for the closest cells to dig into and/or out of.
  If a different MovementZone is set the unit will only dig if both origin and target locations can be dug into; else it'll drive and only re-consider digging after a complete and absolute stop and then giving a new order manually. If persuaded to get underground then given a new order it'll try going to new target location, and if it can't dig out of it it'll look for closest exit only after it reaches/gets directly below the target.
  InfantryWhen pathfinding, only clear ground is considered passable.InfantryDestroyerSame asInfantry, but can destroy terrain obstacles such as trees.FlyWhen pathfinding, it assumes everything passable.WaterWhen pathfinding, considers only water as passable.WaterBeachLike Water but adds Beach cells to pathfinding. Worth noting that RA2TileSetsdon't make use of this properly, and a lot of terrain editing will be required to actually make useable Beach.CrusherAllSame asCrusher, additionally assumes that it can crush any mobile object, as well as walls.[3]

  ## Notes

  Since the [BuildingType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingType) in vanilla lacks handling for rad sites, they are not affected, which has nothing to do with immune logic or [Verses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses).

  [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) adds this part of the handling and further extends it. Refer to Phobos documentation.

  However, you still need to write the global `[Radiation]` from vanilla into the new `[RadiationTypes]` registry through Phobos's new custom radiation form, in order to make the newly added RadApplicationDelay.Building`=` flag in Phobos take effect. Just like below:

  - Starting from Phobos Build#7, Rad.NoOwner on weapons determines whether a rad site has no house, defaulting to no (owned), until it was removed in Build#29.
  From Phobos Build#29 onwards, each Radiation uses its own RadHasOwner to determine whether it has a house and RadHasInvoker to whether it has an invoker, with default behavior reverting to vanilla game conditions.

This is to prevent a ROF cheat by abusing the system. Explicitly, the one weapon cannot, even with target shuffling, fire in a shorter duration than it's ROF dictates.

Fighter="""
  Specify whether this aircraft is a fighter.

  This will allow it to freely launch weapons that use projectile types which do not put the aircraft into a [Strafing](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Strafing) state without needing to constantly find a suitable position to hover before launching, thus it is very useful.

  ## Notes

  The actual effect of this flag is to skip additional checks when firing. For aircraft with Fighter=no, they need to find a point that satisfies the weapon's [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) requirement, hover there, and then face the target to fire, even if the weapon has [OmniFire=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OmniFire). This is particularly evident when both of the following conditions are met: the [Locomotor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor) is set to a type like [Drive](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Drive) that does not require constant movement, and the unit is constrained by weapon parameters, thus preventing it from entering the Strafing state. Whereas Fighter=yes can truly skip this facing check and ignore OmniFire=no. This is somewhat similar to other shots after successfully firing the first shot and entering the Strafing state, the main difference is that Fighter directly participates in the determination of whether firing is possible at an earlier stage.

  Let's take Hornet as an example: in vanilla, each Aircraft Carrier has 3 Hornets as spawnees, each time they are launched, there is a rally behavior among the spawnees that waits for all spawnees to be launched, this causes the first two launched Hornets to circle around before the last Hornet is launched, and this results in them facing a direction that is not towards the target when the rally is complete, if the target is too close, therefore, except for the last one, the Hornets need to make a turn before completing their bombing run, but if the Hornet uses Fighter=yes, then it can smoothly execute the bombing mission after rallying.

  The southern one is vanilla behavior, the northern one addsFighter=yesto the spawnee.
  For aircraft with [Locomotor={B7B49766-E576-11d3-9BD9-00104B972FE8}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Rocket) (Rocket), due to their unique movement style, they are completely unable to maintain the aforementioned point. Therefore, if you need them to launch weapons, Fighter=yes is almost necessary, especially when [MissileSpawn=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MissileSpawn) so that Strafing may not even operate stably.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This causes the aircraft to twist its body when firing.

  This causes the aircraft to have a very short random delay before firing.

  This is the culprit that causes an aircraft with only one Ammo to fire two shots or even three shots in PVP battles.

  Aircraft with this flag will play a fixed animation named `[CARYLAND]` on the ground when landing.

  Carryalls are essentially a variant of the passengers logic. However, after picking up a vehicle, the vehicle will be rendered beneath the aircraft.

  In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), if using standard passengers logic, the images of InfantryTypes passengers loaded in aircraft with Carryall=yes will also be drawn on the aircraft.

  An aircraft can only pick up one vehicle or carry one/multiple infantry, but not both simultaneously. Vehicles cannot enter aircraft through non-pick-up enter actions. Although they display the `Enter` cursor normally, they will only stop beside the aircraft and get stuck in the enter action (e.g., you keep trying to select it, then the selection effect will constantly interrupted), never actually entering.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  In the original game there was no way to set vehicle properties to prevent airlifting, as this logic doesn't check [Size](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Size).

  - Combined with [hardcoded pathfinding limitations of fly locomotor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Fly) that normally only allow landing on land, this causes watercraft to immediately explode when airlifted and dropped on land.
  - Starting with Ares 0.2, relevant settings have been added, with default rules that [Organic=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Organic) and/or [NonVehicle=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NonVehicle) units cannot be picked up.

  If a vehicle is picked up by an aircraft, any [parasites](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Parasite) currently damaging that vehicle will be expelled to the ground of the current cell.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.2.

  Carryalls messed with cargo units in a way that would change their rotation speed. This was because the Carryall's current facing along with its [ROT](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROT) value was forced upon the cargo to give the impression that it is actually mounted below the aircraft. When dropping off the cargo, the original values were not restored.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.D. Also, the facing in which the cargo is dropped off has been changed to be the same as the Carryall facing.

  This feature was not used in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), so there were some issues with the related graphics. The `[CARYLAND]` animation played during landing used [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)'s `anim.pal`, while the pick-up cursor displayed on target vehicles used `NoTogglePower`[1].

  - Starting from Ares 0.2, this was replaced with `Tote`[2], using the blue move cursor graphics. You can freely configure Tote-related parameters in `[MouseCursors]`.

  cursor inTiberian Suncursor inRed Alert 2cursor inAres

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ In `mouse.sha` is frame `384`.
  - ↑ In `mouse.sha` from frame `329` to `338`.

  ## Ares Info

  When a Carryall releases its cargo, it will go on guard mission instead of sitting there frozen. If it was part of a team previously, it will try to rejoin that team. If the unit cannot be placed on the map, it is now put back into the Carryall, instead of potentially disappearing.

  - New in version 2.0.

  ## Anecdote

  When going through the original Rules (both RA2 and YR), you'll find this flag for the Hind Chopper, which was implemented as a JumpJet VehicleType, as opposed to an Aircraft. This could mean that Westwood was planning on extending the Carryall-logic, but either didn't manage it or just decided to scrap the chopper. The Hind is still usable as-is and has its own VXL and HVA in the original MIXs. Do note that the chopper lacks HVA-Animations and seperated sections, and has ridiculous JumpJet-stats.

[AnimType]:[ObjectType]
Shadow="""
  Whether the [Projectiles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Projectiles) or [Animations](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Animations) has a shadow.

  The game uses the latter half of the entire Shape frames as shadow drawing frames, so there's no absolute correspondence between the shadow and the original image.

  - For Projectiles, this latter half is fixed as shadow frames. If Shadow=no, the shadow simply won't be drawn.
  - For Animations, if Shadow=no, the latter half of frames will still be treated as image frames for playback.

  Animations with [Bouncer=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Bouncer) are forced to have shadows that cannot be disabled.

  - In this case, instead of distinguishing shadow frames, the game directly applies grayscale adjustment to the image for shadow use.
  Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#0, you could disable this with Shadow=no.
  Beginning with Build#40 (although the release notes mentioned Build#39, it wasn't actually implemented at that time), it was changed to use ExtraShadow=no.
    - Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#0, you could disable this with Shadow=no.

  Testid123's attempt: If you want the shadow of a building to be higher than the object Delete shadows or do not create shadows for SHP buildings. Then go create the shadow of the SHP building in the form of an animation instead, then setLayer=ground,YSortAdjust=543Doing this will add realism to the shadow.

  ## Notes

  The shadow rendering layer of aerial units often has issues.

  - For example, if the shadow of a unit located further northwest (screen-up) happens to overlap with the on-screen position of another aerial unit's body, the more southeastern unit might be obscured by the former's shadow.

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Shadow_Mirage.png)

  Since the game is not actually 3D, shadows obviously cannot be calculated for situations where they fall on non-flat surfaces.

  - For example, if there is a cliff behind a building, the shadow will still be drawn flat.
  Therefore, in Z-depth computations, the shadow layer is below the cliff image layer, causing the building's shadow to be blocked by the cliff instead.
    - Therefore, in Z-depth computations, the shadow layer is below the cliff image layer, causing the building's shadow to be blocked by the cliff instead.

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Shadow_Limitations(SHP).png)

  When a frame is treated as a shadow, any pixel that is not `0` (as the background color/transparent color) will be considered valid.

  - In [SHP Builder](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SHP_Builder)'s shadow mode, color index `#1` actually corresponds to the selected color index before entering shadow mode. However, after entering shadow mode, the program will only display color index `0` and the current color, while treating the current color as color index `#1` in the palette.

  ## On Animations

  Specifies if this [animation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Animation) should leave behind a crater [smudge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SmudgeTypes). Which smudge type to place is decided according to the formula below.

  Formula
  When an Animation has a spatial height below `30` leptons, it checks for the presence of [Scorch=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Scorch):

  - If Scorch=yes, then check the value of Crater`=`:
  If Crater=yes, there is a probability of `1073741824 / 2147483647 ≈ 0.5000000002328306` to attempt to create SmudgeTypes with Crater=yes, using the following rules:
  Before creation, remove `6` layers of [Tiberium OverlayTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberium_(INI_flag)#OverlayTypes) (if any) in the cell[1].
  Then randomly create a Crater, first checking the state of the target cell:
  The cell is within the currently visible area of the map (In Radar).
  The terrain in the cell is not a slope.
  There is no SmudgeType or OverlayType on the cell.
  If ForceBigCraters=no, then avoid cells containing BuildingTypes.
  The TileSet type used by the cell is [Morphable=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Morphable).
  Then collect all SmudgeTypes with Crater=yes into the first layer list.
  If ForceBigCraters=no, which SmudgeTypes can enter the second layer list depends on the dimensions of the middle frame[2]. If the width is greater than `60` and the height is greater than `50`[3], then all SmudgeTypes can enter. Otherwise, only SmudgeTypes with [Width=1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Width) and [Height=1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Height) can enter.
  Since [Westwood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Westwood) often lists animations from small to large in `[Warhead]`→[AnimList=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AnimList), corresponding to from low to high `[Weapon]`→[Damage=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) values, this cleverly simulates the correlation that weapons with higher damage leave larger craters.
  If ForceBigCraters=yes[4], only SmudgeTypes of size `2x2` or larger enter the second layer list.
  At this point, if there are insufficient empty cells to place SmudgeTypes of size `2x2` or larger, it will fall back to the first layer list for random selection.
  Meanwhile, there is another probability of `1073741823/2147483647 ≈ 0.4999999997671694` to attempt to create SmudgeTypes with Burn=yes, using rules similar to those for creating SmudgeTypes with Crater=yes, but always avoiding cells containing BuildingTypes.

    - If Crater=yes, then `100%` to attempt to create SmudgeTypes with Crater=yes, with the rules as above;
    - If Crater=no, then end the judgment and do not create any SmudgeTypes.

  SmudgeTypes are created when the [Shape](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Shape) file plays to the middle frame[5]. In other words, for an Animation with a Loop, it will attempt to create once every time it reaches the corresponding frame in the cycle defined by [LoopCount=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LoopCount).

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ This also means that if the Tiberium is removed to the point of complete destruction, allowing SmudgeTypes to be created, the created one must be a Crater rather than a Burn Marker, because only the branch for creating the former has the operation of removing Tiberium before creation.
  - ↑ For Shape files with an even total frame count, it is the frame that is later in the middle, e.g., for a shape file with a total length of `12` frames, it is the 7th frame (1-based).
  - ↑ For [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) and [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm), it requires width greater than `48` and height greater than `40`.
  - ↑ [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Warning_small.png) The part related to ForceBigCraters=yes is only valid in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge).
  - ↑ For shape files with an even total frame count, it is at the end of the frame just before the middle; for example, for a shape file with a total length of `12` frames, it is at the end of the 6th frame and before the 7th frame starts playing (1-based). That is to say, if this Animation has [End=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/End) restricting the playback sequence, then End`=` must be at least `6` for SmudgeTypes to be created normally.

  ## IsLocomotor

  On weapons whose warheads have [IsLocomotor=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsLocomotor), this specifies the maximum [Size](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Size) of the target that this weapon is allowed to affect. Meaning, if such a weapon has Damage=5, it won't be able to affect [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) and [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes) which have Size exceeding `5`.

  - This does not affect targeting and firing, only whether the effect is effective.

  ## Animations

  On [animations](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Animations) that don't have [Bouncer=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Bouncer) set, damage is dealt on each frame of the animation using the warhead specified in `[CombatDamage]`→[FlameDamage2=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlameDamage2). Unlike on other objects, Damage can be specified as a decimal number for such animations. If this value is less than 1, the game keeps track of a damage "counter" that increases by the given amount every time the animation frame is updated. Actual damage, worth of 1 hitpoint, is dealt only when this counter reaches an integer. If the counter is a decimal number when the animation ends, 1 hitpoint of damage is dealt regardless.

  [FIRE1]
  Damage=.04
  LoopCount=4
  Suppose this animation is 18 frames long: 18 * 4 loops * 0.04 damage = 2.88 damage in total, which gets rounded up to 3. So, this animation will deal 3 damage using the warhead specified in [FlameDamage2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlameDamage2).

  Animations that do have [Bouncer=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Bouncer) set deal the specified amount of damage on impact with the ground or an object, in an area specified by DamageRadius, using the specified [Warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead). The animation must have a valid [ExpireAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ExpireAnim) value, and must not expire prematurely (i.e. due to completing all frames or loops before impact).

  - The range is first determined by `[Warheads]`→[CellSpread=float - cells](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread). For each enclosed cell, `[Animations]`→[DamageRadius=int - leptons](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DamageRadius) is used internally to decide.
  If debris falls into water, only the impacted cell is ever recorded.
    - If debris falls into water, only the impacted cell is ever recorded.

  ## Notes

  When Damage`*`Verses`< 1`, no actual damage will be dealt due to rounding down.

  [Particles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Particles) do not retain house information, so they will inflict damage to any troops regardless of affiliation.

  About Damage average value:

  - If a techno's [TurretCount=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretCount) value is greater than 0 and [IsGattling=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsGattling), then only the current weapon is used for targeting calculations (for the two multi-weapon cases other than IsGattling, [IsChargeTurret=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsChargeTurret) restricts usage to `(Elite)`[Weapon1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Weapon1), while [Gunner=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Gunner) only has the concept of [current primary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary#Current_Primary_Weapon)).
  - If a techno's [TurretCount=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretCount) value is greater than 0 and IsGattling=yes, then the sum of the Damage and [AmbientDamage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AmbientDamage) values of Weapon1 and Weapon2 is calculated, divided by the number of weapons (2), and rounded toward zero. If this value is greater than or equal to 0, the unit is considered to be attacking; otherwise, it is considered to be performing repairs (using the Repair cursor, requiring the target to be not at full health to fire... just like the Repair IFV in vanilla).
  - If a techno satisfies neither the condition of TurretCount value greater than 0 and IsGattling=no, then the sum of all weapons' Damage and AmbientDamage is calculated and divided by the number of weapons the unit possesses. This also includes cases such as [DeployFireWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployFireWeapon), [OpenTransportWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpenTransportWeapon), and [NoAmmoWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoAmmoWeapon), which are essentially force-use-X-slot-weapon types that specify a weapon index.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value and have [AnimList](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AnimList) specified on their associated warheads would cause an Internal Error upon firing.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.2.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value can only affect units of the same type as the firer, so it is impossible to create a repairman-style infantry to restore the HP of vehicles.

  - This limitation was removed in Ares 0.D.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value does not use the Verses and [PercentAtMax](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PercentAtMax) on the warhead.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#37. They can be made effective by adding ApplyModifiersOnNegativeDamage=yes on the warhead.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value will only affect objects within 8 leptons around the target point even if a larger CellSpread is set.

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#39. CellSpread can be made effective by adding ApplyModifiersOnNegativeDamage=yes on the warhead.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value have a hardcoded search range of `512` leptons.

  - Kratos has been changed to adhere to the weapon's [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range), and in the KratosPP version, it needs to be manually changed to 2.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value are hardcoded to have an effect equivalent to [AG=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AG) on the projectile.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value are hardcoded to directly remove the internal [parasite](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Parasite) of the object being repaired.

  Weapons that have a negative Damage value are hardcoded to prohibit attacking hostile targets. However, in situations where pathfinding rules require a unit to destroy a non-allied unit obstructing its movement to the destination in order to proceed, such weapons will still be considered like conventional weapons. If the enemy unit acting as an obstacle is not at full health[1], the unit will indeed perform repairs on the hostile object.

  When an animation that has this flag set is playing and the cell is obstructed so the infantry cannot be spawned (e.g., a vehicle is parked in that cell), the game will stubbornly keep trying to place it, and cause increasing lag, as well as an ever-growing memory leak, for the remainder of the game session. The only way to prevent accumulating lag is to make sure the cell in question is clear. Note that this also happens when the cell is occupied by invincible objects such as impassable terrain tiles (cliffs, water) or [TerrainTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TerrainTypes) such as ore mines. In this case, there is no fix for the ever growing lag and memory leakage, short of aborting the current game session.

YDrawOffset="""
  Adjust the image's Y-draw offset, which basically means that you can move your image.

  ## Notes

  positive values move the image down, while
  negative values move the image up.

  The values are measured in pixels.

  You can avoid having to edit your SHP files in order to "move" them up or down simply by using this flag . However, note that this will also affect how the image is layered with others. Moving the image up will cause it to be rendered on a "higher" layer (closer to the screen), and vice versa.

  Due to vanilla, you can only use this flag to adjust the image of the animation vertically. From [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build #24, a flag named XDrawOffset was added for horizontal adjustment (positive direction is to the right of the screen).

  The animation named `[RING1]` has some additional hard-coded content that may affect this, although it does not seem to be used. However, from Phobos Build #42, the implementation has been changed to avoid being affected by it. If you have knowledge about this part, please rewrite this paragraph.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  While it generally works correctly with common animations including shape debris, the shadow of building animations in the vertical direction only respects settings such as the [ActiveAnimY](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ActiveAnimY) flag—you should use the corresponding setting flags for the building animation category on the building to control its position. This means if you move an animation using YDrawOffset, when this animation serves as a building's [ActiveAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ActiveAnim), although its own image is moved, its shadow remains at the original location.

  - The XDrawOffset introduced by Phobos does not have this limitation.
  - When ActiveAnimX or ActiveAnimY is set, XDrawOffset or YDrawOffset will not take effect respectively, nor will cumulative calculations be performed on the values.

ZAdjust="""
  This flag adjusts the animation's location on the Z-axis (depth), measured in [leptons](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Leptons). Positive values move the animation "away from the screen" or "closer to the ground". Negative values do the opposite.

  Adjusting the Z-offset is useful for rendering the animation behind or in front of other animations or objects.

  The ZAadjust of other objects is only used to compare levels with these contents.
  That is to say, there is no difference between two animations that use different ZAadjust. YSort controls their order, not ZAadjust.

  [OverlayTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OverlayTypes) does not read or use their `ZAdjust` flag, even though they actually have Z-depth.

StartSound
Report="""
  Specifies a sound (from [sound(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Sound(md).ini) [[SoundList](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SoundList)]) to be played when this weapon fires.

  The oddity here, though, as opposed to most other sound listings (like for example [VoiceDeploy](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VoiceDeploy)) is that while the listing is chosen randomly, it's only chosen once at the creation of the individual unit instead of at each use. Meaning each built unit of that type will only play one listing, and consistantly play it when that unit fires instead of using all options on Report= list.

  The downside is that if one wishes to use the sounds of two sound(md).ini entries, they would have to make one listing for all desired sounds, even if everything is already defined in other entries to that ini.

  The only positive of this quirk is that vehicles can be a bit more individualized by exploiting multiple listings. Such as junky-looking technicals could utilize differing machine gun tones, or a weaponized propaganda truck could have 'unique' public adress system voices for seperate trucks.

  ## Note

  - Since the Report tag does not use electricity to operate, even if the building animation does not play due to the lack of electricity, [but] the continuous (loop) sound specified in the Report section for the building animation will continue to play until the building is destroyed/sold or no longer exists.
  - If you use the [StartSound](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/StartSound) and Report tags in the animation Report tags are ignored.

StopSound
BounceAnim="""
  Only for debris with [Elasticity](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Elasticity)`> 0`, determines the animation played when they trigger a bounce.

  ## Notes

  Due to different position judgments, BounceAnim is always a bit ahead of ExpireAnim's position relative to the velocity vector when the debris lands.

  Shape debris never truly bounces because the animation ends when it expires, but BounceAnim could be a regular animation or another debris.

  - Continuously creating shape debris with a smaller `[Animation]`→[MinZVel=(integer)](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MinZVel) is a method to simulate bouncing. Correspondingly, such 'bouncing' cannot inherit the direction of the original debris.

  ## Notes

  For Shape debris, ExpireAnim is not invoked if the animation expires due to having played through all its [frames](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Frames), or [loops](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LoopCount). However, for Voxel debris, if it ends due to exceeding the time set by [Duration](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Duration), the ExpireAnim can still be created normally without requiring a hit.

  Should this animation deal [damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage), ExpireAnim must refer to a valid animation, else no damage is dealt.

  If debris falls on a tile where [LandType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTypes) is water, the animation from `[CombatDamage]`→[SplashList=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SplashList) will replace the ExpireAnim animation.

The longer the delay, the less trailer animations will be spawned from the parent animation. Only works in conjunction with [TrailerAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TrailerAnim).

  ## Random Variation

  In-game, there appears to be slight variation in how many trailer animations the parent animation will spawn. Most of the time the parent animation will spawn as many trailer animations that fit within its lifetime, however there's a small chance each instance of the parent animation will spawn 1 more or 1 less trailer animations.

  When the infantry enters thegreencell at the bottom left, an invisible animation is spawned on each of the threegreencells at the top right. This animation then spawns the rings asTrailerAnim. The parent anim hasEnd=2,Rate=60,TrailerSeperation=15

  ## Notes

  This flag is valid despite the spelling mistake (TrailerSeperation). Using the correct spelling (TrailerSeparation) won't work.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Although [VoxelAnims](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VoxelAnims) also use TrailerAnim, so in theory they can be limited using TrailerSeperation, however, in fact, for them, this interval is hard-coded as `2` to handle.

  In Ares, this control whether this unit can be sold at [UnitSell=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitSell) docking structures.

  ## Notes

  As mentioned above, it only controls one scenario for changing the cursor; the ability to actually perform the selling action is not affected, so this flag cannot prevent the AI from selling the building.

  This cannot make buildings that are already prohibited from being sold due to reasons such as [Buildup=none](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Buildup) or simultaneously having [UndeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UndeploysInto) and [Foundation=1x1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Foundation) which case it being considered as vehicles, become allowed to be sold.

  By using methods like Buildup=none to remove the buildup animation of buildings, it is more effective in most cases to prevent the building from being sold, and it also changes the cursor to `NoSell`.

  - However, there are still some edge cases, such as the Slave Miner. When the Yuri Ore Refinery executes undeploy, it does not check Buildup or even UndeploysInto; even if both are absent and Unsellable=yes, it will still perform this action.
  Since UndeploysInto is empty, this will manifest as simply being removed from the game.

  ## Notes

  Such buildings can only rely on the occupier to grant them weapons and use them to fire, even though in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), this weapon is originally written in the building itself. For details, see the [Occupier](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Occupier) page.

  In other words, the occupier only provides weapons to the buildings, while the one who actually fires is the building itself[1].

  InRed Alert 2
  In non-expanded [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), CanBeOccupied was intended to be used for civilian structures only. If a [building](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) with CanBeOccupied=yes is constructed by a player, it will revert to being owned by the neutral [house](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/House). Correspondingly, the effects brought by flags like [GapGenerator=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GapGenerator) will also belong to the neutral house.

  - In this case, [FreeUnit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FreeUnit) will not give the vehicle to either the player who built the building or to neutral.
  - If that building's [Art(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Art.ini) entry also has a [Buildup](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Buildup) animation, the AI of the neutral house will sell the building immediately upon construction.

  InYuri's Revenge
  [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) expanded the behavior of this logic: only buildings with [TechLevel=-1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechLevel) will perform the actions from [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), while buildings with other TechLevel values (including other negative values) will retain their original house like normal buildings, just like Soviet Battle Bunker.

  Nevertheless, the AI still tends to regard them as civilian structures in certain determinations.

  Buildings using this logic have a special image sequence.

  - If it is a civilian building (TechLevel=-1), then the third frame (and the corresponding shadow frame) is used as the image for the occupied state, and the fourth frame (and the corresponding shadow frame) is used as the rubble left after destruction.
  - If it is not a civilian building, then the fourth frame will also be used for the damaged image in the occupied state, so it will be difficult to pair with [LeaveRubble](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LeaveRubble).

  Here is an example of incorrect display for a building with TechLevel not equal to `-1` when it is damaged under occupied state.

  Occupiable neutral structures are abandoned by their occupants when they are damaged to red health. As long as the building isn’t repaired, no infantry could occupy it again. Battle Bunkers will not throw out their occupiers once they reach red health, though new infantry still could not enter them.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.6, and infantry will still allowed to enter Battle Bunkers when in red health.

  Infantry could gain experience killing enemies while occupying a structure, but unlike units in [OpenTopped](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpenTopped) vehicles (and with Ares with [Gunner](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Gunner) vehicles also), occupiers are not promoted immediately. They had to exit the building first, and only after doing this would they use the elite weapon when occupying a structure again.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.D. With Ares, the promotion now happens immediately and without exiting, but it is silent, that is, no sound will play.

  When infantry are about to enter an occupiable building that has been removed and is not real dead will trigger [EIP#7FB178](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_007FB178)

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#48.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Accordingly, if a player's infantry enters a neutral building and it does not change owner, then it will attack the player's objects just like normal neutral buildings do, for example, by placing a Soviet Battle Bunker that belongs to a neutral house on the map.

  ## Notes

  The detonation delay for a building killed by this warhead varies linearly across the affected area. At the warhead's center, the delay is [DelayKillFrames](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DelayKillFrames). At the maximum range (defined by [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread)), the delay becomes DelayKillFrames × [DelayKillAtMax](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DelayKillAtMax).

  This means that for a building at a distance of `Distance` (in leptons) from the center, the delay length is:

  DelayFrames = DelayKillFrames + (DelayKillFrames × (DelayKillAtMax - 1) × Distance) ÷ (CellSpread × 256)
  If the building already has [C4](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/C4) planted (another logic that detonates the entire building after a period of time), this delay will be compared with the remaining delay of the C4. If this delay is shorter, it will override the C4 timer.

  ## Notes

  Setting NeedsEngineer=yes causes a building, when captured, to not play `EVA_BuildingCaptured` but instead use `EVA_Tech_BuildingCaptured`, and when losing the building, it uses `EVA_TechBuildingLost`.

  - Starting from [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), the program no longer hardcodes a string to control the captured EVA event; instead, it allows specification via [CaptureEvaEvent=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CaptureEvaEvent).
  - Starting from [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.9, it allows the use of [LostEvaEvent=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LostEvaEvent) to specify the EVA event when losing the building.
  Additionally, it allows specifying a [CSF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CSF) label via [Message.Capture=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Message.Capture) and [Message.Lost=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Message.Lost) respectively for each of these situations to send a message in the top-left corner of the screen.

  NeedsEngineer=yes also prevents a neutral structure from auto acquiring and firing upon units - as seen on the Tech Outpost structure, such buildings are usually listed in `[AI]`→[NeutralTechBuildings=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NeutralTechBuildings).

  - Additionally, since targeting of engineers by the AI is remarkably bogus, the NeedsEngineer=yes will cause engineers to target it when given any generic attack mission. The flag will also prevent the AI from immediately selling the building after an engineer captures it.

  NeedsEngineer controls whether a tech building is offline until it is captured by an engineer. Until then, it should not play any active animations, yet when a building with NeedsEngineer=yes was damaged into yellow health and switched to the damaged graphics, the animations started to play as if it had been captured. This did not affect the functionality, though.

  This value indicates that this building can manufacture other [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes).

  Specifies the [vehicle](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleType) that should appear beside this [building](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) when it is placed after being constructed by the player (the unit comes free with the building). In the unmodded games, this logic is only used by Tiberium/Ore Refineries to spawn free Harvesters/Miners.

  The FreeUnit [Cost](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost) is not taken into account when the building is sold. In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), the building's [Soylent](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Soylent) is based on the Cost of the building only, so you need to set the Soylent for the building manually. In the case of the Ore Refinery, Soylent is set to 300 because the Ore Refinery has Cost=2000 and its FreeUnit has Cost=1400 (in the unmodded game, you get `50%` refund when you sell a building).

  ## FreeUnit and Industrial Plant Logic

  As far as [Industrial Plant logic](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FactoryPlant) is concerned, 'free units' are not actually free.
  In the case of the Ore Refinery ([Cost=2000](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost)), the game thinks you are paying for a 1400 credit ore miner and a 600 credit Ore Refinery at the same time.

  Assuming the original Industrial Plant settings are used, VehicleTypes prices are reduced to 75% and BuildingTypes prices are not reduced. Therefore the price of the Ore Refinery becomes:

  (0.75 x 1400) + 600 = 1650
  If the Industrial Plant is set so that BuildingTypes prices were reduced to 50% as well (or made a new Industrial Plant), then the price of the Ore Refinery would become:

  (0.75 x 1400) + (0.5 x 600) = 1350
  Note that multiple Industrial Plants stack their bonuses. For example, owning two Industrial Plants would cause the price of the Ore Refinery to become:

  (0.75 x (0.75 x 1400)) + 600 = 1387.5

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If the [Cost](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cost) of the FreeUnit is higher than the Cost of the building, then the price of the building will be overridden to match the Cost of the FreeUnit.

  - For example, if you have a building with Cost=500 and its FreeUnit has Cost=2000 then the building will actually cost `2000` in-game.
  - However, the construction speed of the building is not affected by this change in price.

  If the player owns an Industrial Plant that reduces the cost of vehicles and/or buildings, using a very small multiplier, such as 0.01, then FreeUnit logic will cease to function on all other buildings. The free unit will not be created.

  ## Notes

  Such buildings also come with an effect that allows selling vehicles during repair, as long as those vehicles can dock and move to the building's center cell. For `[NADEPT]`, in the vanilla version, which uses a `4x3` [foundation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Foundation) and other settings, there is no true 'center' cell. The cursor hovering over the vehicle will display as `SellUnit` (in `mouse.sha` from frame `139` to `148`). This feature was removed in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) version 1.001, but [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) has restored it.

  - Ares 3.0 changes the logic to work with a unit's individual dock position on each building instead.

  The AI is extremely dumb about using repair bays of any kind - it will blindly send Kirovs and Siege Choppers there despite the fact that they can never actually get repaired, and it will not differentiate between a land-based and water-based repair bay when a unit can reach both (e.g. Robot Tank). In some cases, a non Naval unit will enter a Shipyard for repairs, but the Shipyard will not repair it. So, it would be wise not to give the AI any repair bays.

  For [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), if you use this flag on Bio Reactor, it will allow [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) to enter Bio Reactor only if it receives the damage.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  - In unmodded [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), this flag is commented out from the entries for the Allied Airforce Command Center and its American equivalent, along with a comment

  ;gs this is part of reloading + being an aircraft (Repair code is oogly, only Reload got rewritten for four ports.).
  - The comment fails to mention any bugs, but reenabling it on such a structure will have adverse side-effects and even cause an [Internal Error](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error) - when an AI's unit is damaged, it will attempt to find the closest structure it has with this flag enabled (regardless of whether the unit can actually enter it), and send the unit there for repairs. If that destination structure happens to be an airpad, the game will enter an infinite loop and crash.
  In addition to this, even aircraft that can legitimately land in this structure will trigger its repair loop after landing, and this loop will kick them off once they're fully repaired, meaning that an aircraft sent to dock with such a structure will never manage to do it.

Bunker="""
  Specify that this building is a Tank Bunker, just like Yuri's one in vanilla. After entering, the vehicle will receive a series of bonuses.

  ## Notes

  When a vehicle enters this building, it plays the sound specified by `[AudioVisual]`→[BunkerWallsUpSound=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BunkerWallsUpSound); when it leaves, it plays the sound specified by `[AudioVisual]`→[BunkerWallsDownSound=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BunkerWallsDownSound).

  When a vehicle has entered a building, it will read the flag under the ***Tank Bunker*** section:

  - its weapon damage will be multiplied by `[CombatDamage]`→[BunkerDamageMultiplier=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BunkerDamageMultiplier),
  - fire rate[1] will be multiplied by `[CombatDamage]`→[BunkerROFMultiplier=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BunkerROFMultiplier),
  - and weapon [range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range#On_Weapons) will be increased[2] by `[CombatDamage]`→[BunkerWeaponRangeBonus=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BunkerWeaponRangeBonus).

  For a vehicle to be able to enter this building, at least one side of it must be longer than `1` cell. That is, a building with [Foundation=1x1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Foundation) will allow the vehicle to initiate the enter command and approach, but it cannot actually enter the building.

  - A normal Tank Bunker will stutter when a vehicle enters it, but if this building also has [ConstructionYard=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConstructionYard), then its entry process will be incredibly smooth. If one of your Tank Bunkers always fails to enter due to having too large a Foundation, then you can try this.
  - Additionally, it is necessary to ensure that the vehicle can drive to the required position, so things like [NumberImpassableRows](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NumberImpassableRows) should be used to make the building have passable parts.

  If this building has weapons and is firing when entered, it will stop firing but retain the target, and resume attacking the original target when the vehicle leaves the building.

  In any case, the Tank Bunker can only enter one vehicle, and it does not check [NumberOfDocks](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NumberOfDocks), no matter if you set it to `0`, `9`, or anything else.

  Unit attack determination will have an additional check for vehicles in a bunker. If a unit's weapon range is less than `384` leptons (`1.5` cells)[3], then that weapon will be prohibited from acquiring the `Attack` cursor on vehicles inside the bunker.

  If a vehicle successfully enters the building, it will stop at the center-most position, with its body facing due south (bottom-left of the screen). For buildings with even side lengths, this will occupy the cell biased towards the bottom of the screen, while the actual position moves half a cell in the opposite direction, and it is corrected back to the correct position when the vehicle exits the building.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If it is a building with an odd side length, this position correction will cause an error in the actual position after the unit leaves the building, meaning that the center of the cell it occupies is not the center of its entity. This will cause functions that rely on cell judgment to malfunction, for example, vanilla [Arcing](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Arcing) projectiles will attack the wrong position, making such units appear to have 100% evasion.

  Lasher Light Tankwith misaligned coordinates after leaving theTank Bunkerwith an odd side length.
  This cannot be used together with other entry logics like [InfantryAbsorb](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryAbsorb).

  - Firstly, in this case, InfantryAbsorb=yes will allow [UnitAbsorb](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitAbsorb) to work, and its default value is no, preventing vehicles from entering.
  - But even if [UnitAbsorb=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitAbsorb) is set also[4], it will still cause the vehicle to only attempt to enter the building but never actually enter.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Actually, it performs division on the rearm time, thus it is multiplication for the firing rate, meaning the larger this value, the higher the firing frequency.
  - ↑ Note that this is not multiplication but addition.
  - ↑ This might be a special handling for melee units, or more accurately, it might be targeted at Yuri Brute.
  - ↑ If the building does have [Passengers](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Passengers) settings, it will prioritize that, and when it cannot hold more passengers, it will revert to the above behavior.

  ## References

  Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#48, the bonuses provided by the Tank Bunker and the sound effects for entering/exiting the Tank Bunker can be customized on the building itself. Refer to Phobos documentation.

Cloning="""
  Designate this structure as a Clone Cultivation Chamber. It will simultaneously create an infantry unit whenever a [Factory=InfantryType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory#InfantryType) building (typically barracks) of the same house produces infantry, similar to the Cloning Vat in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2).

  ## Notes

  When setting this on a structure (let's call it 'Structure A') which has [Factory=InfantryType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory#InfantryType) set aswell, the structure will produce infantry like normal barracks, but these infantry units will not be cloned by any instance of Structure A if they are produced by an instance of Structure A. Infantry units will however be cloned by all instances of Structure A owned by a given player if that player produces these units in an instance of another type of structure (such as normal barracks). An interesting effect could thus be achieved by giving one side (or country) a building for infantry production which has Cloning=yes set. The side (or country) could produce infantry the normal way, however upon capturing or building another side's Barracks, all of their own barracks would function as Cloning Vats for every infantry unit produced in that other sides's Barracks.

  Wether instances of a structure type with Cloning=yes clone infantry that has been produced by an instance of another structure type with Cloning=yes still requires testing.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Adding the Cloning=yes tag to [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) that use the [Refinery=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Refinery) tag will result in the following:

  - You will no longer be able to produce [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) with the [BuildLimit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildLimit) tag for the rest of the game (after the first creation). Even if those [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) do not exist in the game (this glitch is equivalent to BuildLimit=-1, except it's a little special in that you can see the icons for those [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) even though you can't produce them).[](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cloning%3Dyes%2BRefinery%3Dyes_on_BuildingTypes.gif)

  [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.2 fixed an issue where buildings marked as Cloning=yes did not respond to production when an Infantry Factory had [WeaponsFactory=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponsFactory), but introduced a new fake cloning problem where, in situations where cloning should not occur, cloned units might appear in strange ways, including but not limited to probabilistically exiting from Tech Oil Derricks granted to the player by map triggers...

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 3.0p1.

  ## References

  In vanilla, cloning vats can work fine even low power. Starting from Ares 2.0, they need power to work. Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build #49, this can be customized and is by default consistent with the behavior in vanilla. Refer to Phobos documentation.

ConstructionYard="""
  Enables special logic for undeployable buildings. Among several more minor things, buildings with this tag set to `yes` can show the construction animation when a structure is placed, and support the MCV Redeploy feature. Also, the Center Base keyboard command searches for buildings with this tag enabled.

  If the AI deploys a vehicle into a building with ConstructionYard=yes, base building and auto-production is enabled in non-campaign game modes.

  If ConstructionYard=yes, structures distinguish between selling and undeploying, also respecting the MCV Redeploy setting. If ConstructionYard=no, structures will be converted into a unit even if sold. That is, instead of disappearing, the crew is ejected and the unit defined by [UndeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UndeploysInto) is placed also.

  In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), Vehicle Thieves can only steal buildings that are ConstructionYard=no.

WeaponsFactory="""
  The presence of WeaponsFactory=yes on a [BuildingType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingType) turns it into a "War Factory" with specific logic attached.

  ## Notes

  One feature of such a building, is that it produces [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes), which exit from a specific cell inside the building (based on foundation shape), either through a door for ground units, or through the roof for [Jumpjet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Jumpjet) VehicleType.

  The production logic can work normally on the [Factory=UnitType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory#UnitType) setting.

  - When [Naval=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Naval), it is produced like war factory - the units will be produced from inside factory and then move outside the factory. If there is a rally point setting, it will move to the location of rally point. When it has the [ExitCoord=X, Y, Z](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ExitCoord) setting, use the position filled in here as the production unit's production location. If the location is outside the factory, the produced VehicleType will be produced from this location first and then teleported back to the interior of the factory, moving towards the rally point; If it is a Jumpjet VehicleType, it will take off directly from this location after production and move towards the rally point.
  - When Naval=yes, the unit will be produced from the side of the factory edge that is closer to the rally point and will move to the rally point position.
  In this situation, ExitCoord=X, Y, Z is invalid.
    - In this situation, ExitCoord=X, Y, Z is invalid.
  - When the factory has Factory=UnitType but does not have WeaponsFactory=yes, the units produced will appear from the northwest direction of the building. The factory can still place the rally point, but the produced units will not be moved to rally point.

  For buildings with Factory=InfantryType or Factory=UnitType, this allows them to create animations specified by [ProductionAnim=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ProductionAnim).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Adding WeaponsFactory=yes to buildings with [DockUnload=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DockUnload) will prevent the [harvesters](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Harvester) from completing unload when they dock, and those vehicles will remain in the [Entermission](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Mission_Control) state at the dock position

  Adding WeaponsFactory=yes to buildings with [Hospital=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Hospital) and/or [Armory=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Armory) will prevent infantry from being released after entering.

  When WeaponsFactory=yes is added to a BuildingType with Factory=InfantryType settings, this Infantry Factory will not trigger the response of the BuildingType with [Cloning=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cloning) when creating InfantryType, meaning cloning will not occur.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.2.

  When WeaponsFactory=yes is added to a BuildingType with Factory=InfantryType settings, the produced InfantryType will move to the position of cell #10 of the [Foundation=5x3](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Foundation) buildings[1] instead of the rally point. However, if this BuildingType has Naval=yes setting at the same time, InfantryType will behave like VehicleType in the same situation, and be produced around the BuildingType and moved to rally point.

  When WeaponsFactory=yes is added to a BuildingType with [UnitRepair=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitRepair) settings, the vast majority of damage suffered by the unit being repaired will be transferred to the BuildingType, and some special effects will be directly invalidated, such as [IsLocomotor=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsLocomotor), [Temporal=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Temporal), and [radiation site](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Radiation). This can even prevent [organic units](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Organic) from being instantly killed by the [Type=IronCurtain](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Type) superweapon, although it does not grant them the Iron Curtain buff.

FirestormWall="""
  Whether or not this `BuildingType` is part of the Firestorm Defense system. Buildings can be placed like walls, connecting to each other over a distance, and changing their appearance depending on whether neighbouring cells also contain Firestorm Wall sections.

  ## Notes

  The Firestorm logic does not exist in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), but this tag is still parsed. All functions related to activation are not available.

  - In version 0.1, Ares reimplemented this logic, refer to documentation.

  ## Properties

  Firestorm Wall sections have properties that change depending on whether the Firestorm Defense is active or not.

  If the Firestorm is active, the Wall cannot be traversed by units, and units entering the wall section are destroyed using FirestormWarhead if they are [IgnoresFirestorm=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IgnoresFirestorm). Otherwise the wall section behaves like an open gate.

  Active Firestorm Wall sections burn [IgnoresFirestorm=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IgnoresFirestorm) projectiles targeting or traversing the wall. Ambient and spread damage is converted and reduces the charge of the super weapon. Inactive Wall sections take damage like normal buildings.

  Only inactive Firestorm Wall sections can be sold.

  ## Frame order

  The shape file for this building type is expected to have 64 frames followed by 64 shadow frames in this order: 16 for the inactive state, 16 for the damaged inactive state, 16 for the active state and another 16 for the damaged active state. The damaged frames are unused.

  Each block of 16 images represent all possible combinations of neighbouring cells containing another Firestorm Wall to connect to. The connection points can be viewed as bits, so frame 0 connects to no other walls, 1 connects to the top-right neighbour, 2 connects to the bottom-right neighbour, 4 to the bottom-left and 8 to the top-left. Adding these values gives the frame number for that number of connections. For example, frame 12 is a corner connecting to the two upper neighbours.

Armory="""
  This flag determines whether the building will automatically promote any [infantry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) that enter it to Elite [veterancy](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Veterancy) status.
  The [Ammo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ammo) flag must be used on an armory, otherwise it can only promote one soldier. It can also be used to restrict the number of infantry that can be promoted. Once it has used up all of its "promotions" it will no longer function as an armory. If no restriction is desired, using a value of `999` is practical. `-1` won't give it infinite ammo. The game appears to take the absolute value (positive -> positive, negative -> positive) for armories.

  If an armory has [Powered=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Powered), it will still function even in a low-power situation.
  If an armory is placed offline via an in-game mechanism (like in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)), it will not function.

  In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), multiple soldiers can be selected at once and ordered into the armory; forming a queue line similar to the way multiple units enter a transport when ordered simultaneously. This makes promoting your soldiers a much less arduous task than it was in Tiberian Sun, where each soldier would have to be ordered into the armory separately.

  Conyard Armory: Just Don't
  Applying `Armory=yes` to a construction yard ([ConstructionYard=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConstructionYard)) causes glitchy behavior. When sending an infantry unit in to be promoted, the building will cycle through its image frames rapidly and the unit will never come back out.

  Blocked Armory (RA2)
  When an infantry unit enters an Armory it disappears and reappears a short time later in the upper left corner of the building. Unfortunately, the unit does not move away from the building when it exits. The unit is partially obscured by the building and can be difficult to mouse-over the correct part of the screen in order to click to select the unit and move it away manually.
  Units that have just exited the building will also block other units from being ordered to enter until the offending unit is moved away. However if units are already queuing for the building (see above) then the next unit in the queue will enter automatically as soon as the unit ahead of it is moved out of the way).

  Partial Fix Accompanied by Cloning Bug (RA2)
  By making the Armory a barracks ([Factory=InfantryType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory)) you are able to set a rally point in order to avoid the above problem, however doing so will cause any [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) you have with [Cloning=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cloning) set to spawn a copy of the newly-promoted unit (not promoted of course) as if you had just trained it.

  Screwy AI with Armory Factory
  Using this on a building that also has [Factory=UnitType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory) or [Factory=InfantryType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory) set causes the AI to spam only one type of unit from that factory, the first vehicle/infantry type that the AI can build (i.e. the AI [house](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/House) is listed as the object's [Owner](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Owner)).

  Armory Barracks Jackpot IE of Death (TS)
  Not only is the aforementioned AI bug a concern, but using a combination armory barracks has other complications as well — dire complications. If a player attempts to train infantry while promoting on the same building, there is a rare chance that both soldiers will try to exit the building at the same moment. This causes an [IE](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IE) (debug code needed).

  Glitchy Ammo Logic
  If the Armory has a weapon, both promoting infantry AND each firing of the weapon will decrease the Ammo counter. Once the counter is zero, the Armory will no longer fire OR promote infantry as the Armory tag prevents Ammo from reloading.

  Infantry Restrictions
  Any Building with Armory=yes receive special protection Makes it impossible for any infantry to attack.;;Except for attacks with tag commands.

  ## Values

  When using positive values of `1`, `2`, or `3`, these represent the corresponding slot number on the parent buildings. In this case, once an upgrade has been installed on a parent building, it cannot be installed again.

  Using `-1` also prevents other upgrades that use `1`, `2`, or `3` from being installed on the same parent. However, any upgrades, whether itself or others, that also use PowersUpToLevel=-1 can continue to be installed until the number specified by the parent building's [Upgrades=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Upgrades) is reached.

  Any upgrades using other values cannot be installed on buildings.

  ## Notes

  While the simultaneous firing of both [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) and [Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) weapons is applicable to all the upgrade numbers, in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) there is [hardcoded](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Hardcoded) restriction for the Component Tower to not allow this for PowersUpToLevel=2 and PowersUpToLevel=3 as those are coded for RPG and SAM Upgrades.

  [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) and [Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) usually have same weapons when used in upgrades. There are issues if different weapons are used as those would show the firing cursor depending on the range of the weapons but have problems in actually firing.

  ## Upgrade Image

  When upgrades are installed to parent buildings, the parent buildings will play the animations specified by their Image= setting. If there are multiple upgrades, multiple animations will be played. A special case is that for parent buildings named `[GACWTR]`, they are hardcoded to be treated as [turrets](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret).

  Among them, upgrades with PowersUpToLevel`=` values of `1`, `2`, or `3` will also cause the parent buildings to play animations specified by their own [PowerUpXAnim=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PowerUpXAnim) setting.

  The animations created by the images of the first three upgrades will also, according to their creation order, use the data from the three PowerUpXAnim*[1] settings except flags for specifying the animation entity type, meaning they use the same coordinate and layer settings. For those beyond the third, they are fixed at the origin of the coordinate system.

  Note
  In a way, in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), only upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=-1 work fairly well.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  However, at least since [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), there have been issues with the invocation rules for the animations specified by PowerUpXAnim.

  - PowersUpToLevel=1 does not create any of them,
  - PowersUpToLevel=2 creates the animation specified by
  _
  PowerUp2Anim
  _,
  - PowersUpToLevel=3 creates the animations specified by
  _
  PowerUp2Anim="""
  Redirect to:

  - [PowersUpToLevel#Upgrade Image](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PowersUpToLevel#Upgrade_Image)
"""
  and PowerUp3Anim.

  When parent buildings are damaged, it removes the animations created by the upgrades' Image`=`[2] and creates Damaged versions of the above animations. In all three cases, it additionally creates the animation specified by PowerUp1AnimDamaged. Specifically:

  - PowersUpToLevel=1 creates the animation specified by
  PowerUp1AnimDamaged
  _
  _,
  - PowersUpToLevel=2 creates the animations specified by
  PowerUp1AnimDamaged
  and PowerUp2AnimDamaged
  _,
  - PowersUpToLevel=3 creates the animations specified by
  PowerUp1AnimDamaged
  PowerUp2AnimDamaged
  and PowerUp3AnimDamaged.

  For upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=-1, they do not use PowerUpXAnim, but PowerUpXAnimDamaged will correctly replace the animations created by the first three upgrades based on the number of existing upgrades[3] when parent buildings are damaged, and the fourth and subsequent upgrades still use the animations created by their Image`=`.

  However, there are even worse things. We previously mentioned that PowerUpXAnim* is effective for upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=-1 in corresponding slots, and the animation specified by PowerUp1Anim`=` never appears, while the animation specified by PowerUp1AnimDamaged`=` always appears when damaged state. Here, there is actually a more serious algorithm issue:

  - First, to supplement a point we didn't mention before, when upgrades have PowersUpLevel`=` `1`, `2`, or `3`, the animations called by their Image`=` always occupy slot#1. If you first install upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=-1 on another parent building of the same type, the program will remember the animations called by the Image`=` of the last upgrades installed in slot#2 and slot#3.
  When installing upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=1, there is no effect because only one animation is created, which is determined by the upgrade's Image`=`.
  When installing upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=2, it creates two animations; For the second one:
  if the program recorded the last upgrade with PowersUpToLevel=-1 installed in slot#2, it will create the animation specified by its Image`=`;
  if it doesn't exist, it creates the animation specified by the parent building's PowerUp2Anim`=`.
  When installing upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=3, it creates the second and the third animations in the same way.
    - When installing upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=1, there is no effect because only one animation is created, which is determined by the upgrade's Image`=`.
    - When installing upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=2, it creates two animations; For the second one:
  if the program recorded the last upgrade with PowersUpToLevel=-1 installed in slot#2, it will create the animation specified by its Image`=`;
  if it doesn't exist, it creates the animation specified by the parent building's PowerUp2Anim`=`.
    - When installing upgrades with PowersUpToLevel=3, it creates the second and the third animations in the same way.

  To summarize:

  - If you first install two upgrades with PowersUpLevel=-1 in the orderA then Bon a parent building with Upgrades=4, then when you install a PowersUpToLevel=3 upgrade on another parent building, it will create the animation specified by upgrade B's Image`=` in slot#2 instead of the one specified by PowerUp2Anim`=`, and in slot#3, it will create the animation specified by PowerUp3Anim`=`.
  - Then, if you install four upgrades with PowersUpLevel=-1 in the orderB, A, B, Aon another parent building, when you install a PowersUpToLevel=3 upgrade on another parent building, it will create the animation specified by upgrade A's Image`=` in slot#2 instead of PowerUp2Anim`=`, and in slot#3, it will create the animation specified by upgrade B's Image`=` instead of PowerUp3Anim`=`.

  Note
  This bug only affects the creation of animations; the actual installation of upgrades is not abnormal.

  For upgrades with PowersUpLevel set to a positive value, if the animation called by the upgrade's Image`=` is not an infinite loop, then it will not prevent upgrades with PowersUpLevel=-1 from being installed on this parent building. Considering that upgrades with PowersUpLevel`=` `1`, `2`, or `3` occupy a corresponding number of slots, therefore, the same parent building in this case can first install one upgrade with a positive PowersUpLevel, and then install (Upgrades - PowersUpLevel) upgrades with PowersUpLevel=-1.

  ## In [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos)

  Starting from Phobos Build#39, building upgrade animations can use power controls through the use of new flags:

  - PowerUpXPowered,
  - PowerUpXPoweredLight,
  - PowerUpXPoweredEffect,
  - PowerUpXPoweredSpecial.

  Starting from Phobos Build #44, this part has been implemented:

  - For upgrades with PowersUpLevel`=` `1`, `2`, or `3`, they will only create animations specified by PowerUpXAnim`=` or PowerUpXAnimDamaged`=` corresponding to their own sequence number, based on whether the parent buildings are in a damaged state.
  - Another change is that when PowerUpXAnim`=` is present, it will no longer create animations specified by the upgrade's own Image`=`, and this also applies to upgrades with PowersUpLevel=-1 that are installed on the first three parent buildings.
  - Moreover, when parent buildings are in a damaged state, non-damaged state animations will be correctly deleted.
  Of course, if damaged state animations are not specified, the original non-damaged state animations will be used instead.
    - Of course, if damaged state animations are not specified, the original non-damaged state animations will be used instead.

  Instant barrel
  Of the deployer flags, this one is unique in that the building's [Voxel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Voxel) [turret](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnimIsVoxel) and [barrel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BarrelAnimIsVoxel), if any, is rendered as soon as the building is deployed (i.e. before the [buildup](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Buildup) animation has completed).

  Buildup anim issues
  In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) and [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm), there is a sequencing bug here which can cause graphical discrepancies when the unit is undeploying from structure form back to vehicle form:

  - step 1: the undeploy anim plays (i.e. the deploying anim but in reverse) until it is done
  - step 2: the base structure art image is shown again
  - step 3: the building turret returns to its neutral position (pointing top-right by default); for a low ROT, this could take a while
  - step 4: the structure object turns into an unit object

  In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) this is particularly visible on the Nod Artillery unit when it undeploys:

  - the undeploy anim will play, where the Artillery piece pulls the outrigger legs back into its body
  - it then reverts to the normal "deployed artillery" structure image - which shows the outrigger legs back out again - while the turret turns back to its neutral orientation
  - ...and then only does it turn into a vehicle.

IsBaseDefense="""
  IsBaseDefense=yes on a building makes it a base defense structure, and the AI chooses from available [buildings](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) with this set when selecting a base defense to build. The total number of base defense structures to be built in relation to the base size is determined by the values in [GDIBaseDefenseCoefficient](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GDIBaseDefenseCoefficient) and [NodBaseDefenseCoefficient](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NodBaseDefenseCoefficient). See [MaximumBaseDefenseValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MaximumBaseDefenseValue) for more information on how the AI distributes this number along the available defense structures.

  InRed Alert 2
  RA2 uses [AlliedBaseDefenseCounts](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedBaseDefenseCounts) and [SovietBaseDefenseCounts](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SovietBaseDefenseCounts) to determine the preferred base defense counts, of buildings with IsBaseDefense set. However there is a slight exception to this, [BuildDummy](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildDummy) is a list of low-tier defensive buildings to build between other core structures, and is not included in the defense count limits. Technically any auxiliary buildings can be added to BuildDummy as filler structures, to form part of the building queue.

  Since RA2 has both a basic defense list with [BuildDefense](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildDefense), and a high-tier [BuildPDefense](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildPDefense) list for excess power conditions, expected as the AI base develops, BuildDummy actually allows three tiers of defensive structures, and more of them than the counts would suggest. This setup also enables the building of at least some defenses outside of the normal threat assessment regime, but possibly influenced by [ThreatPosed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ThreatPosed) values on them.

  InYuri's Revenge
  The IsBaseDefense=yes isn't used for building AI base defenses. Instead they are built according to the lists provided in [AlliedBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedBaseDefenses), [SovietBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SovietBaseDefenses) and [ThirdBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ThirdBaseDefenses). [AlliedBaseDefenseCounts](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedBaseDefenseCounts), [SovietBaseDefenseCounts](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SovietBaseDefenseCounts) and [ThirdBaseDefenseCounts](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ThirdBaseDefenseCounts) determine how many of each. Proportions of these buildings is calculated based on the values of [AntiInfantryValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AntiInfantryValue), [AntiArmorValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AntiArmorValue) and [AntiAirValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AntiAirValue) and influenced by [AIForcePredictionFudge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AIForcePredictionFudge), for fine-grained control.

  Purpose of this flag on Buildings
  1. In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) and [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), it is used by the AI to build base defense buildings ([Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) does not use this flag for building base defenses).

  2. The AI uses IsBaseDefense to identify structures for base defense target selection in [ai(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ai.ini) scripts, as well as for [SuperWeapons](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SuperWeapons). For more on AI targeting, see: [ScriptTypes/ScriptActions](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ScriptTypes/ScriptActions). In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), structures explicitly declared in [AlliedBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedBaseDefenses) etc. have preference over building with this flag.

  ## On TeamTypes

  IsBaseDefense=yes on a [TeamType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TeamTypes) assigns it as a defensive team. The total number of such teams is subject to the limits set by [MinimumAIDefensiveTeams](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MinimumAIDefensiveTeams) and [MaximumAIDefensiveTeams](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MaximumAIDefensiveTeams) under the [General] section.

  Defensive teams can be produced even without the AI choosing an enemy, see: [AIHateDelays](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AIHateDelays).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  On Buildings: Although the AI automatically builds buildings with IsBaseDefense=yes set in TS, it cannot use such buildings as [prerequisites](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Prerequisite) for other buildings, unless the defense structure also has [AIBuildThis=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AIBuildThis) set.

  On TeamTypes: As the AI attempts to build base defense teams first, failure to build [MinimumAIDefensiveTeams](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MinimumAIDefensiveTeams) with [UseMinDefenseRule=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UseMinDefenseRule), may result in an inability to build any teams demanded by [AI Triggers](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AITriggerTypes).
"""
IsThreatRatingNode="""
  This flag, when set to yes, will turn the structure into what has been called a "Threat Rating Node". This alters the AI of your units slightly, so that they assess incoming threats to a better extent than they did before. Basically, upon this being built, your objects will switch over from using the "dumb threat" coefficients defined in [General](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/General) and instead use the "default threat" coefficients instead.

  A side effect, however, due to the Threat Rating Node's somewhat broken logic, is that the effect is permanent for the rest of that game. When the Threat Rating Node is destroyed, the effect will still remain regardless of whether it is rebuilt or not, and the player's units will still have the benefits of it.

  According to an Ares developer, this flag is inactive since Tiberium Sun. The flag is globally active via house settings and the "default threat coefficients" are always in effect. Even the function that would deactivate the flag activates it instead.

Power
ExtraPower="""
  Specifies the extra power for special functions of this building. Positive values generate electricity, negative values consume power. Depending on whether the Gap Generator effect is used, there are two working methods as follows.

  In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), this is used for the Allied Gap Generator. Such buildings have the [GapGenerator=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GapGenerator) setting. Normally, [GapRadiusInCells](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GapRadiusInCells) controls the effect range. When surplus power sufficiently covers the additional consumption required by ExtraPower, deploying the building switches it to a high-power mode, consuming more power while expanding the range to that specified by [SuperGapRadiusInCells](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SuperGapRadiusInCells).

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Yro.png)In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), this is used for the Yuri Bio Reactor. This type of building has [UnitAbsorb=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitAbsorb) and/or [InfantryAbsorb=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryAbsorb) settings. For every unit that enters, it outputs additional power specified by ExtraPower. That is:

  the total power output =[BuildingType]→ExtraPower* number of units +[BuildingType]→Power
  even if the building's own [Power](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Power) is negative.

  ## Notes

  For the former, this only checks whether the power surplus value can cover the power required by ExtraPower, i.e., whether `min(Power Surplus Value, Power Surplus Value + ExtraPower) > 0`.

  - If true, then when the building is selected, it will show a deploy cursor; clicking it will enter high-power-consumption mode.
  - If false, the building will not show the deploy cursor, and any already in high-power-consumption mode will fall back to normal mode.

  If ExtraPower`> 0`, then although there is still a power requirement to deploy, the power value will not change after deployment.

  For the latter, this only checks the number of units, and if ExtraPower is negative, no effect will occur.

  Both working methods can be used together.

  - For example, if InfantryAbsorb and [Passengers](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Passengers).etc are added to `[GAGAP]`, and ExtraPower is set to `+100`, then for each infantry that enters, the total power generation becomes `n * 100 (ExtraPower) + (-100) (Power)`.
  And when the Power Surplus <= 0, GAGAP will not show the deploy cursor, making it impossible to eject passengers from the building this way.
  Furthermore, in this situation, buildings in high-power mode will not automatically revert to normal mode when the Power Surplus is insufficient; instead, they require manual deployment to return to normal mode. However, due to the insufficient Power Surplus, the deploy cursor will not be shown thereafter.
    - And when the Power Surplus <= 0, GAGAP will not show the deploy cursor, making it impossible to eject passengers from the building this way.

  After the building is deployed, certain functions will remain temporarily unavailable due to their mission being set to unload until the mission status returns to guard.

  - If a building with this feature also has a [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) weapon, 'deploying' the building will also cause it to fire its primary weapon at the ground underneath it. The building will continue to fire until manually stopped via the 'Stop' keyboard shortcut or by manually ordering it to target somewhere else. It will not stop by switching back to its normal power level. Switching it back after it has manually been stopped from firing will simply cause the building to start firing at the ground again.
"""
Height="""
  In [Art(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Art.ini), this flag is placed on [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) art entry and specifies how tall a building is. This influences how high [JumpJets](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpJet) and [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) have to ascend to fly over this building. It also controls how high the health bracket is drawn above the building.

  ## In Rules

  In [Rules(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules.ini), this flag is placed on [SmudgeTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SmudgeTypes), and tells the game the amount of cells occupied by this SmudgeType along the Y axis (in map cell terms, meaning top-right -> bottom-left).

  ## In Maps

  [Header]
  In the header of maps, this flag tells the game the length of its preview's Y-axis in pixels, i.e. its height in 2-dimensional image terms.

  [RandomMap]
  On saved random maps, `Height` also gives the "height" of the map in the sense of its length from north edge to south edge (i.e. diagonally from top-left to bottom-right). This is done on a scale from 1 to 5, with 1 signifying a small map, and 5 signifying a very large one. Presumably, this is done for automatic selection of maps in quick matches or something similar. (iow, so a user can select he would like to play on a "large" map, for example.)
  This value cannot be set manually - it is determined automatically by the [Random Map Generator](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=Rmg.ini&action=edit&redlink=1).

However, it was not meant to be used this way; Overlay images do not render until the camera pans off and back onto the screen. When used with bridge overlays, the bridges do not perform as they should. When used with crates, the crates do not despawn and can be picked up repeatedly. Bizarrely, infantry units that have picked up any of the tainted crates will scatter whenever another tainted crate is picked up.

  ## Accepted values

  All values are case-insensitive. Any other values will simply be ignored and the default used instead; however [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) can be utilized to create custom foundations. The first number represents the cell-count along the NW-SE axis, the second along the NE-SW axis.

  0x0, 6x4, 3x4, 4x4, 5x3, 2x5, 2x6, 1x5, 1x4, 4x3, 3x1, 1x3, 3x3REFINERY, 4x2, 3x5, 3x3, 3x2, 2x3, 2x2, 1x2, 2x1, 1x1
  3x3REFINERY
  Foundation=3x3REFINERYgrid illustration
  3x3REFINERY
  is an unusual shape. While all other foundation values are rectangles, this one has an empty cell in the center of the third row.
  Albeit containing "Refinery" in the value string, this will not work for a [Refinery](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Refinery) because the harvester's docking point inside a refinery is [hardcoded](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Hardcoded) to be the second [cell](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cell) in the fourth row, which is outside of the foundation in this case.

  6x4
  Foundation=6x4grid illustration.
  In Tiberian Sun, 6x4 produces an unusual shape. The foundation is shaped like a rectangle, but with three empty cells at the southwest side. It was used for the Scrin Ship and probably coded to match the building art.

  0x0
  Foundation `0x0` works a bit differently from the others as well. Such structures are completely immune to normal [weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Weapons) damage and thus cannot be destroyed in the standard way. They however are vulnerable to weapons whose [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warheads) has [Temporal=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Temporal). `0x0` structures do not occupy physical space, which allows units to move over the cell one of these structures was placed on. They also display their appropriate [UIName](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UIName) strings if the cursor is hovered over the cell the structure was placed on. Apart from this, they function pretty much like structures with normal foundations, although the [AI](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AI) has some issues handling them↓.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This flag is read from [art(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Art.ini) twice: from section you specified in rules as `[object]`→Image , and from simply `[object]` , and the second one overrules the first if present. This causes weird behaviour, like setting

  [GAYARD]
  Image=NAHAND
  in rules still requires a 4x4 Foundation to place, contrary to what logic dictates - you need to remove the Foundation flag from GAYARD to get it to use NAHAND's one.

  AI Treatment of Foundation 0x0
  The AI is apparently stupid enough to think that 0x0 structures don't actually exist on the battlefield, and continues to build more and more of them instead of just one.

  - Similarly, for a building with the top(0,0) cell hollowed out, the AI will also consider it non-existent and ignore counting it, therefore continuously attempting to produce and build.

  Construction Yards
  The AI seems to have a problem using a Construction Yard with any Foundation smaller than 2x2, it will deploy the construction yard but will not build anything.

  Weapons Factories
  The preferred exit point for a unit exiting a [Weapons Factory](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponsFactory) is hardcoded to be the 8th and 11th cells in TS and RA2/YR respectively (counted from the building origin by increasing X, then Y).

  0x0 TerrainType
  In vanilla, when handling the TerrainTypes in the `[Terrain]` list for map placement in the game, it fails to correctly calculate the position of 0x0 TerrainTypes, and triggers [EIP#00568432](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_00568432) when loading the map.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#29.

  ## [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares)'s Custom Foundations

  Ares introduced custom foundations with version 0.1. Building Foundations can now be any shape and size, not just the few predefined options previously available. For example, you can now recreate the old Red Alert Repair Depot foundation. The INI coding is rather complex, so instead of writing it manually, it’s recommended to use the Custom Foundation Generator developed by Renegade.

  When creating foundations, don't forget to create the outlines.

  New Values and Flags
  - Foundation=custom    ; Initiates the custom foundation logic.
  - Foundation.X    ; Length of the foundation along the X axis.
  - Foundation.Y    ; Length of the foundation along the Y axis.
  - Foundation.#    ; Replace # with an integer starting from 0. The coordinates of each cell in the foundation.
  - FoundationOutline.Length    ; The 'perimeter' of the foundation's outline.
  - FoundationOutline.#    ; Replace # with an integer starting from 0 up to (FoundationOutline.Length - 1). The coordinates of each cell in the foundation's outline.

  Sample Code
  The code below represents a foundation in the form of a cross.

  Foundation = Custom
  Foundation.X = 5
  Foundation.Y = 5
  Foundation.0 = 1,0
  Foundation.1 = 0,1
  Foundation.2 = 1,1
  Foundation.3 = 2,1
  Foundation.4 = 1,2
  FoundationOutline.Length = 16
  FoundationOutline.0 = 0,-1
  FoundationOutline.1 = 1,-1
  FoundationOutline.2 = 2,-1
  FoundationOutline.3 = -1,0
  FoundationOutline.4 = 0,0
  FoundationOutline.5 = 2,0
  FoundationOutline.6 = 3,0
  FoundationOutline.7 = -1,1
  FoundationOutline.8 = 3,1
  FoundationOutline.9 = -1,2
  FoundationOutline.10 = 0,2
  FoundationOutline.11 = 2,2
  FoundationOutline.12 = 3,2
  FoundationOutline.13 = 0,3
  FoundationOutline.14 = 1,3
  FoundationOutline.15 = 2,3
  Notes
  [Weapons Factories](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponsFactory) are hard-coded to use the unit exit paths from the original game so changing the foundation for these buildings is not recommended.

  The Custom Foundation Generator located with the Renegade Project Network is incompatible with Google Chrome, and results in gibberish. Be advised.

  - In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), using special anims with refineries gives highly unusual results; if the harvester has no ore, then the animation will not be played at all. It appears that the animation plays frames, up to a short but unknown limit, depending on how much ore the harvester deposits. Presumably this is part of an unused logic to play an 'ore dumping' animation.

  ## Voxel Turret

  To render a [voxel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Voxel) turret on a building, simply put the voxel's file name into the TurretAnim input and give the building the additional tag [TurretAnimIsVoxel=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnimIsVoxel); the game will render the voxel directly onto the building without a need for a corresponding [art(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Art.ini) entry.

  Through my various tests, I found that Voxel Turret can have more than one turret.[](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Voxel_Turret_x2.png)
  Normally you cannot specify TurretAnim=VoxelWO is possible, but if you define it like this: It will be available.
  example:
  [GAPOWR]
  [Image=DESTWO](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Image)
  [Turret=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret)
  TurretAnim=DEST
  [TurretAnimIsVoxel=True](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnimIsVoxel)
  ...
  Results[](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:TurretAnim%3DDEST.png)
  If you don't follow the above method. But it's set normally.
  [GAPOWR]
  [Image=DEST](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Image)
  [Turret=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret)
  TurretAnim=DESTWO
  [TurretAnimIsVoxel=True](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnimIsVoxel)
  ...
  It will give results like this[](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:TurretAnim%3DDESTWO.png)

  ## SHP Turret

  Turret shape orientation should start from the ▲ direction and rotate counter-clockwise, like in this example.
  To render a turret
  shape
  on a building, list the
  .shp
  animation entry in the
  TurretAnim
  input and see that
  TurretAnimIsVoxel=false
  ; the game will expect that the turret animation has an
  art(md).ini
  entry. Turret shapes should have 32 frames and can have shadow frames, which unlike .shp-based vehicles turrets, do animate their shadows.
  It will also need these:

  LoopStart=0LoopEnd=32LoopCount=-1Rate=0
  SHP images in TurretAnim can be replaced with other SHP images if the SHP file is specified in the TurretAnim tag. has the tag [Theater=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Theater) (applies only to theaters where the SHP file has the extension of that theater, such as testtur.tem).
  Normally name of the SHP turret must be specified in the section. [Animations](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Animations) to make it available.
  But if the turret name SHP(animation) is defined in the [Trailer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Trailer) and [TrailerAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TrailerAnim) You do not need to specify Put it in the section [Animations](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Animations)
  example:
  [RING1] ;Name of Animations in this section must be specified in the section. [Animations](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Animations) also, otherwise doing this would be useless.
  [Trailer=TURSHP](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Trailer)
  [TrailerAnim=TURSHP](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TrailerAnim)

  ## Charge Animation

  Here the turret logic has been "hijacked" for a special purpose. If the building has no turret ([Turret=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret)) but has a valid TurretAnim entry and a [primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) weapon with [Charges=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Charges), then this animation is used for the weapon charge-up animation. When the building acquires a target, this animation will play before the weapon can actually fire. An example of this is the Obelisk of Light in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun). Use [TurretChargeAnimRate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretChargeAnimRate) to specify the animation speed.

  ;Even though the turret voxels cannot have shadows But you can create one fake turret and then lowerits height.

BarrelAnimIsVoxel="""
  Specifies whether or not this building's barrel uses a [voxel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VXL) image.

  ## Notes

  Generally, this will ignore [TurretAnimIsVoxel=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnimIsVoxel) and force [TurretAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretAnim) to use [Shape](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Shape). In this case, [VoxelBarrelFile=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VoxelBarrelFile) is used to specify a voxel barrel.

  The exception is when TurretAnim specifies a name corresponding to a turret under the default naming convention for buildings, for example, `[GTGCAN]` sets TurretAnim=GTGCANTUR. In this case, this flag does not take effect, and VoxelBarrelFile, which relies on its effect, will not take effect either. The barrel is fixed to use the corresponding name under the default naming convention, i.e. `GTGCANBARL`.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Although BarrelAnimIsVoxel=yes already forces TurretAnim to be shaped, in vanilla it must be used together with TurretAnimIsVoxel=yes, which requires TurretAnim to use a voxel resource file. This creates an absurd situation: in the end, TurretAnim cannot use any kind of image resource file, and the game will only draw a Voxel barrel determined by VoxelBarrelFile.

  - Starting from [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 2.0, this has been changed: the logic can now operate with TurretAnimIsVoxel=no, meaning it can normally use a Shape turret and a Voxel barrel.

  This represents both an Example Animation Turret name and an example filenames for a Voxel turret, with the .vxl extension excluded.

  Similar to [PrimaryFireFLH](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PrimaryFireFLH), if the building's weapon has [Burst=2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Burst) or higher, the second shot uses a mirror of the lateral offset. However, unlike PrimaryFireFLH, the third and any subsequent burst shots are always fired from the middle. This seems specifically coded with the Juggernaut's triple-barrel configuration in mind.

  Also note that, due to using [special voxel barrel logic](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BarrelAnimIsVoxel), normal firing offset adjustments like [PrimaryFireFLH](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PrimaryFireFLH) and [PBarrelLength](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PBarrelLength) do not apply.

  If you have ever played Tiberian Sun, you should remember the upgrade system that GDI had. Upgrades are buildable animations placed on top of buildings that provide additional features such as extra power or different weapons. Although not used, this system also works in RA2 and YR.

  This is an example of the basic statements that Complete Upgrade System needs to have.

  ;Rules(md).ini
  [Animations]
  ...= ...(List all the animations you have used.)

  ;Rules(md).ini
  [PARENT_BUILDING]Image=...Upgrades=...[UPGRADE_BUILDING]PowersUpBuilding=PARENT_BUILDINGPowersUpToLevel=...; Art(md).ini
  [PARENT_BUILDING]PowerUpXAnim=...PowerUpXDamagedAnim=...PowerUpXLocXX=...PowerUpXLocYY=...PowerUpXLocZZ=...PowerUpXYSort=...
  Actually, PowerUpXAnim=... is not used, correspondingly, the Image=... in Rules(md).ini setting of the Parent BuildingType will be added to the animation on the Parent BuildingType, after the Upgrade BuildingType is built. However no harm can be done by listing them manually.

  Flag List
  What Upgrades CAN Have or DoUpgrade is more like the override of specific building properties, rather than the actual buildings. Therefore, only certain flags can take effect. However, there are still some things that are "added" rather than "overridden".
  - [SuperWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SuperWeapon) - Add
  - [SuperWeapon2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SuperWeapon2) - Add
  - [Power](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Power) - Add
  - [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) - Override
  - [Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) - Override
  - [WeaponX](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponX) - Override
  In addition, the flags related to the construction can also function normally. For example, [TechLevel](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechLevel), [AIBasePlanningSide](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AIBasePlanningSide), [Prerequisite](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Prerequisite)......
  What Upgrades CANNOT Have or Do
  - [ReloadIncrement](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ReloadIncrement)

  Weapon Overrides
  Normal Setting（Only One Upgrade）
  Upgrade BuildingType will change most of the weapon settings in the Parent BuildingType. When the Parent BuildingType uses normal weapon settings（Primary and Secondary）, BuildingType must follow the following rules to enable it to fire normally after being placed.

  - Both Primary and Secondary must be set as valid weapons, otherwise they will not be able to actually fire. Even if Secondary=none.

  Meanwhile, you should pay attention to this information to better debug your Upgrade BuildingType.

  - When Primary and Secondary do not point to the same weapon, ROF will be ignored. Both weapons will fire at an extremely fast frequency. On the contrary, follow ROF normally.
  - Attack Targeting Rules is always determined by the primary, including but not limited to Range and Verses, AG...... But specifically, when Primary has AA=no and Secondary has AA=yes, it will select ground targets with the settings of Primary and select air targets with the settings of Secondary.
  - Primary and Secondary must fire simultaneously and attack the same target at the same time. This means that regardless of Verses, Range, or AA, as long as one of them can fire, the other will also attack together, although theoretically it should not do so. Please refer to the previous section for attack rules. This may be one of the factors leading to the ROF issues, but even though both weapons have the same ROF, it still cannot be solved.

  Gattling System（Only One Upgrade）
  When [Gattling Weapon System](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Gattling_Weapon_System) is used in the Parent BuildingType, Upgrades BuildingType can perform limited overrides on the weapon system under correct settings if If you specify the [WeaponX](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponX) for its weapons. In addition, all flags will be determined by Weapon1. Meanwhile, in this situation, the weapons at the same stage should also follow the normal rules of Upgrade BuildingType to ensure that they can fire normally. Weapon1 and Primary, Weapon2 and Secondary are basically the same. The stage timer, number of weapons and other settings are all determined by the Parent BuildingType.

  - What The New Weapon Stage Of Upgrade BuildingType CAN Override
  [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range)

  ## IFV Logic

  Weapon number 'X' (ie. Weapon1=someweapon) specifies the weapon available on the named turret with the value of 'X', for example ShockTurretWeapon. One possibly confusing aspect is that the turret used, as defined by the named turret index doesn't have to match the weapon number, many of the IFV weapons actually use the same turret art.

  There are 13 IFV turrets in the original RA2, expanded to 17 in YR, defined by [TurretCount](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TurretCount), each with its own weapon. In RA2 this means there are Weapon1 through Weapon13 tags on the IFV, along with [EliteWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EliteWeaponX) versions. There is also a special case for NormalTurretWeapon which applies without a passenger too.

  Infantry meant to board the IFV must have [IFVMode](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IFVMode) set to to select the weapon the IFV will have when loaded. Importantly, the IFVMode value applies to the IFV turret weapon, not the turret index, so while the Initiate has IFVMode=13, matching InitiateTurretWeapon=13, it does not match InitiateTurretIndex=3.

  ## Charge Turret Logic

  This use of `WeaponX` is decoupled from the turret changing, and instead only uses 1 weapon for multiple turrets, and as such WeaponCount will always be 1, while TurretCount will always be higher.

  Charge turret logic also works backwards, and should be considered more like a recoil or cooldown animation, with the turret changing sequence happening after the weapon is fired. In the case of the Prism Tank, the reflective flap is closed until fired, then fully opened immediately after, slowly closing thereafter, rather than getting into a firing state just before firing.

  ## Gattling Logic

  Every two `WeaponX` will form a group to handle the AG and AA tasks in each phase of Gattling. For specific operational details, please refer to [IsGattling](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsGattling).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  In the original games, there can be only one IFV unit, hardcoded to the unit named [FV]. Otherwise, the Turret will not be drawn.

  - Ares fixes this, and allows any vehicle to function as an IFV, with more turrets: https://ares-developers.github.io/Ares-docs/new/gunner.html

  ## Note

  When activating the WeaponX system using any flag including [IsGattling](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsGattling), flags like [NoAmmoWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoAmmoWeapon) can specify any valid WeaponX weapon index. Among various systems, the native rules of the Gattling Weapon System most closely resemble the [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary)/[Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) system logic when WeaponX is inactive, making the Gattling Weapon System with [WeaponStages](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponStages)-imposed stage limitations the optimal choice.

  - Note: WeaponX invoked by other flags remains unaffected by WeaponStages.

  [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) resolves the issue where odd/even weapon sequences in Gattling systems couldn't toggle like traditional dual-weapon systems. Weapon1 and Weapon2 can now operate like native dual weapons, while flags such as [NoAmmoWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoAmmoWeapon) , [DeployFireWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployFireWeapon) , ForceWeapon.UnderEMP(Phobos) , and ForceWeapon.InRange(Phobos) allow specifying dedicated weapons for scenarios like ammunition depletion or target is under EMP.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  In the original games, there can be only one IFV unit, hardcoded to the unit named [FV]. Otherwise, the Turret will not be drawn.

  - Ares fixes this, and allows any vehicle to function as an IFV, with more turrets: https://ares-developers.github.io/Ares-docs/new/gunner.html

  ## Note

  When activating the WeaponX system using any flag including [IsGattling](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsGattling), flags like [NoAmmoWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoAmmoWeapon) can specify any valid WeaponX weapon index. Among various systems, the native rules of the Gattling Weapon System most closely resemble the [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary)/[Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) system logic when WeaponX is inactive, making the Gattling Weapon System with [WeaponStages](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeaponStages)-imposed stage limitations the optimal choice.

  - Note: WeaponX invoked by other flags remains unaffected by WeaponStages.

  [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) resolves the issue where odd/even weapon sequences in Gattling systems couldn't toggle like traditional dual-weapon systems. Weapon1 and Weapon2 can now operate like native dual weapons, while flags such as [NoAmmoWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoAmmoWeapon) , [DeployFireWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployFireWeapon) , ForceWeapon.UnderEMP(Phobos) , and ForceWeapon.InRange(Phobos) allow specifying dedicated weapons for scenarios like ammunition depletion or target is under EMP.

  In  Tiberium Sun, [AIBuildThis](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AIBuildThis) works normally. The Upgrade BuildingTypes of Upgrade Center are built in this way. As well as [IsBaseDefense](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsBaseDefense), Component Tower works in this way.
  In Yuri's Revenge, add Upgrade BuildingType to the Base Defense BuildingType ([AlliedBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AlliedBaseDefenses), [SovietBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SovietBaseDefenses), [ThirdBaseDefenses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ThirdBaseDefenses)) so that AI can normally build them under appropriate conditions. This is seen as a more convenient way. But during testing, it appears that [AntiInfantryValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AntiInfantryValue), [AntiArmorValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AntiArmorValue), and [AntiAirValue](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AntiAirValue) are not effective.

  Known Upgrade Problems
  - Upgrades can not add/override the [DeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeploysInto)/[UndeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UndeploysInto)= on their parent building.
  - Upgrades can not give the player ability to build new unit(s). If you attempt to do so, each building built after the plugin causes the new unit(s) to disappear from the sidebar, making them unbuildable again.
  - The AuxBuilding superweapon logic does not work when upgrades are involved: Upgrade BuildingType will ignore AuxBuilding and add super weapons; When Upgrade BuildingTyoe is the key value of AuxBuilding, this condition will never be met.
  - Although unused in the vanilla games, the flags PowerUp#DamagedAnim are listed in [art(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Art.ini) – albeit with a spelling error. The last two words of the flags are switched around: e.g. they are listed as PowerUp#AnimDamaged while the correct format is PowerUp#DamagedAnim. The flags themselves, when typed in correctly, work as expected.
  - Normally, An Upgraded BuildingType cannot select units that do not meet the attack rules as the first target for attack. But when the Upgraded BuildingType fires and then commands it to  switch attack target, it can ignore the attack rules and attack any unit.

  Except for buildings with [Helipad=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Helipad), which use this flag to determine how many aircraft can park at this airfield, buildings with [DockUnload=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DockUnload), [UnitRepair=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitRepair), or [Bunker=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Bunker) do not actually require this flag; they inherently have one dock slot even if NumberOfDocks=0. Moreover, setting NumberOfDocks=2 (or higher) may cause incorrect interactions (see the #Bugs section below).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Setting NumberOfDocks=2 (or higher) on buildings not using the Helipad=yes functionality causes some issues and they will not work as intended.

  - This is most normal on buildings with DockUnload=yes because the number of docks is hard-coded to be limited[1], so it will not cause any change.
  - On buildings with Bunker=yes, even NumberOfDocks=2 cannot allow a second vehicle to enter it. Although this may cause the `Enter` cursor to appear over the building when selecting other vehicles after one has already entered, clicking will only cause the vehicle to revert to its default task and remain on [Guard mission](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Mission_Control) without even approaching the building.
  - On buildings with [UnitRepair=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitRepair), it is the worst: if NumberOfDocks=2 allows two vehicles to dock to this building simultaneously, there is incorrect mission handling, and it may trigger [EIP#0044C71E](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_0044C71E).

Arm="""
  This tag is used to prevent premature detonation of the [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warheads) fuse. There are two aspects to this fuse, one is that a countdown timer is started, during which the projectile won't explode, and the second is a distance test, whereby it will explode at it's closest logical point horizontally.

  The effect of this is that an Arm= value too low, can cause a projectile to 'jump' to the target, and value too high can cause it to overshoot without exploding, most common with low-[ROT](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROT) projectiles. A projectile with both high ROT= and high Arm= values, may circle or reverse course to hit the target after the arming delay expires.

  There are other quirks to the behaviour, in that the fuse will go off early if the target is moving away from the firer, when the calculation is that the distance between the projectile and target has grown relative to expectation.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Fast moving [aircraft](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) can 'run into' their own projectiles, when the projectile isn't able to signicantly outpace the firer, thus damaging the aircraft. Adding a reasonable Arm= value can prevent this. Vertically dropped projectiles from slow moving airborne units can also suffer from this effect, it is why the Kirov's bombs have an arming delay set.

  It has been said that this flag makes the projectile inaccurate. This effect is true at farther ranges.

  ## In Tiberian Sun to Yuri's Revenge

  Arcing=yes makes the projectile travel at a fixed [speed](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Speed) of `50`[1], ignoring both [Acceleration](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Acceleration) and the weapon's Speed. It also makes the weapon able to shoot slightly farther than its [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) would suggest, and this extra distance is only increased with elevation (i.e. from a cliff top).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

Ranged="""
  This flag has different meanings in the various games. It is documented with projectiles being able to run out of fuel and has been introduced in [Red Alert](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert), but it appears to work this way only in [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm).

  ## Red Alert

  At least in Red Alert 3.03 Ranged seems only be used for considering a projectile inaccurate (see [Inaccurate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Inaccurate)). Apparently it is not used for detonating projectiles in air and all projectiles should explode after 255 frames regardless of the value of this tag.

  ## Firestorm

  Actually works as intended, albeit only in conjunction with [ProjectileRange](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ProjectileRange). If the projectile exceeds the weapon's ProjectileRange before reaching the target, it detonates immediately.

  ## Tiberian Sun, Red Alert 2 and Yuri's Revenge

  [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun), [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) read Ranged but apparently do not use the value.

  An additional effect is that for weapons that use projectiles with Ranged=no, when they attack aerial targets, the actual detonation position might be the ground directly below, even if this is a projectile with [Inviso=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Inviso).

  Additionally, when Ranged=yes, it will also allow [Degenerates=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Degenerates) to work.

  ## [FlakScatter](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FlakScatter) Effect

  If a projectile satisfies `(`Arcing `&&` Inaccurate `&&` FlakScatter`)`, like the attack ground weapon of Flak Track in vanilla, then its shell impact point will apply a range formed by the superposition of two scatter rules.

  The red part in the above figure is a marker for the available circular impact point range created by an Inviso class projectile at a distance of `6` cells with an equivalent[1] scatter range.

  If a projectile satisfies `(`Arcing `&&` Inaccurate `&&` !FlakScatter`)`, then it is roughly an ellipse with the target point as the short axis endpoint close to the firer, and with the BallisticScatter value as the short axis length and semi-major axis length. However, the distance between the firer and the target affects this, so that at closer distances, the shell impact points shift more towards the firer's direction, to the extent that when BallisticScatter`/Distance` is large, it cannot form a closed shape.

  [CombatDamage]
  BallisticScatter=3

  [SOMEPROJECTILE]
  Arcing=true

  ## Notes

  In early games, the scatter radius range was influenced by [HomingScatter](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/HomingScatter), but from [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun) to [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), it ranged from `0` to the value defined by `[CombatDamage]`→[BallisticScatter=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BallisticScatter).

  For projectiles with Arcing=yes or Inviso=yes, this can make them unaffected by `[BuildingType]`→[TargetCoordOffset=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TargetCoordOffset).

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Inaccurate=yes prevents projectiles to 'snap' to their target on impact, and thus they will not deal damage to them because this does not count as a direct hit even if ballistic scatter is set to a low value.

  - Using [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread) fixes this.

  ## Notes

  This flag only enables scatter effects for projectiles of the [Inviso](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Inviso) class. However, it also has some impact on projectiles of the [Arcing](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Arcing) class that have already activated scatter effects via [Inaccurate=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Inaccurate#FlakScatter_Effect). The following scatter rules are explained for projectiles of the Inviso class.

  The range of scatter is calculated according to the following equation:

  scatter radius = random(0, 2 * BallisticScatter) * (Distance[1]/ Range)
  - First, randomly generate an integer in the range from `0` to `2 *``[CombatDamage]`→[BallisticScatter=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BallisticScatter).
  - Then, calculate the distance ratio by dividing the distance to the target point by the value of `[Weapon]`→[Range=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) to get a scaling factor.
  The closer the target, the smaller the ratio; when the target is at the edge of the range, the ratio approaches `1`.
    - The closer the target, the smaller the ratio; when the target is at the edge of the range, the ratio approaches `1`.
  - Next, multiply the results of the first two steps to obtain the maximum scatter radius.
  - Then, generate a random angle, and convert the scatter radius into:
  `Horizontal offset = scatter radius × cosine of the angle`
  `Vertical   offset = scatter radius × sine   of the angle`
    - `Horizontal offset = scatter radius × cosine of the angle`
    - `Vertical   offset = scatter radius × sine   of the angle`
  - Finally, the bullet will land at a random point within this circle centered on the target.

  ## In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)

  If a projectile has Airburst=yes, an AirburstWeapon and Cluster, the Cluster stat determines the amount of AirburstWeapon instances to spawn.

  The cluster projectile will randomly spread in a 7x7 (in cells) square around the target for impact and detonation.

  ## In [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm)

  Airburst and [Splits](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Splits) exhibit a high degree of correlation.

  When a projectile has Airburst=yes, its default value is Splits=no.

  When a projectile has Airburst=yes, its default value is Splits=yes.

  Airburst only determines the VeryHigh trajectory of the projectile, and can no longer make it randomly hit the cells around the airburst point.

  If a projectile has Airburst on a projectile will cause it to ignore its Cluster setting.

  ## Notes

  - In Red Alert2 to Yuri's Revenge, because VeryHigh only applies to homing projectiles however, it is possible to force the use of AirburstWeapons on projectiles that detonate on the ground, by using Arcing or Inviso projectiles. However, doing so will only cause the AirburstWeapons to detonate in the exact same spot as the carrying projectile, instead of spreading them around the impact. But In Tiberian Sun to FireStorm, these projectiles have a probability of spawning cluster projectiles normally.
  - Setting an AirburstWeapon without setting Airburst=yes has no effect at all.

  Like with [ShrapnelWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShrapnelWeapon), the weapon referenced here must be attached to some (potentially dummy) [TechnoType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoType), so that the game loads it at startup. Failure to do so will result in [Internal Errors](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error) when this weapon is supposed to fire.

  Since this causes the sub-projectile to detonate mid-air(Visually close to the ground, but actually not), [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread) applies spherical calculations instead of circular ones.

  If a projectile weapon has [Vertical=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical), it will always hit directly below rather than `3x3` area, even with [AroundTarget=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AroundTarget) (Ares Only), regardless of whether it uses [Voxel graphics](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical#When_using_Voxel_graphics) or [Shape graphics](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical#When_using_Shape_graphics).

ShrapnelWeapon="""
  If set, the warhead will fire this weapon upon detonation, from the impact point, if the impact point is not inside a structure. The amount of shots to fire is set by [ShrapnelCount](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShrapnelCount)=.
  This is used for the Prism Tank reflection effect.

  The working mechanism of ShrapnelWeapon is as follows:
  When there are [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes), [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes), [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes) and [TerrainTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TerrainTypes) on the ground of the cell where the explosion occurs (meaning that attacks against aerial units or units on elevated bridges are actually judged based on the situation in the cell directly below), it generates the quantity determined by ShrapnelCount. If the weapon's [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range) >1.0, it uses the same method as CellSpread to search for available non-ally house targets (including [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) in addition to the aforementioned items) within Range according to the lookup table order (ignoring target's [Immune=bool](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Immune) and [Armor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Armor) attributes). If there are remaining shrapnel after assigning one shrapnel to each target, the excess shrapnel will randomly select cells within a 2-cell radius (5x5 area) around the explosion point (without checking for ally objects on the cells at this stage).

  ## Notes

  Like with [AirburstWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirburstWeapon), this weapon has to be attached to some (potentially dummy) unit, so that the game loads this weapon at startup time. Failing to do so will result in [Internal Errors](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error) whenever the shrapnel effect is supposed to fire.

  Typically this is a ray fired from the firing position in a specific direction. If it fails to hit the target, it will continue flying until stopped by terrain. However, if the projectile also has [Ranged=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ranged), then within the [ProjectileRange](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ProjectileRange) allowed, it will form a finite line segment from the firing point to the target point, even if the target unit has already left the original target location, refer to this post.

  - If the weapon is launched by an [AircraftTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes), it will have a "solid impact" effect, not just for the terrain collisional, it will detonate upon encountering the first enemy-owned object (for [buildings](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes), an additional [SubjectToBuildings=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SubjectToBuildings) is required) in its flight path.

  When usingVoxelgraphics
  If the elevation difference is greater than the horizontal distance, it will move vertically according to the relative up/down direction (e.g., will fly vertically upward after being launched from a missile silo), otherwise it will fly horizontally

  When usingShapegraphics
  The projectile will travel along a straight line from the firing point to the target point, not necessarily in vertical or horizontal directions. However, if flying horizontally and failing to collide with the target due to various reasons, it will continue horizontal flight.

  Destination Transfer
  When vehicles and aircraft using this type of projectile have [BalloonHover=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BalloonHover) and the attack target has [Locomotor={92612C46-F71F-11d1-AC9F-006008055BB5}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Jumpjet) (Jumpjet), the firer will proceed to the target's movement destination.

  - Depending on the firer's Locomotor value, there will be different behaviors:

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  When combined with a positive [ROT](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROT), it take precedence over Vertical, turning the projectile into an ordinary homing projectile.

  ## Example

  [InfantryType]
  ...
  DeathAnims=Anim0,Anim1,Anim2,Anim3......
  ...
  Each elements in this sequence corresponds to the assignment of [Warhead] > [InfDeath=<int>](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath)
  like
  [InfDeath=0](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) → Anim0,
  [InfDeath=3](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) → Anim3

  If [InfDeath](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath)= is too large, there is no corresponding element, then, the last one in the list will be played. So you can enjoy using [InfDeath=14](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) or other, As long as its corresponding element is still within the upper character reading limit of DeathAnims=.

  - DeathAnims=none will disable this logic and use the settings in [General] as before.

  If you want a sequence similar to the original effect, you can try this one:

  [InfantryType]
  ...
  DeathAnims=dummy,<die1>,<die2>,S_BANG34,FLAMEGUY,ELECTRO,YURIDIE,NUKEDIE,VIRUSD,GENDEATH,BRUTDIE
  ...

  ## Note

  This list is only valid for 15 entries, that is, the range of [InfDeath](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath)=0-14. If you want to fully utilize this, you need to use Ares's [Warhead] > [InfDeathAnim=<animation>](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeathAnim) to redefine all the original generic death animations for each warhead (a simple batch replacement) to free up these 15 slots.

  - Only then can you better use this death animation settings defined for the deceased.

  If [InfDeath=15](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath), and the [Infantry] > DeathAnims list does indeed have the corresponding 16th item.it should theoretically play the 16th entry (counting from 1) in the list defined by [Infantry] > DeathAnims=.

  - However, in practice, it will play an empty effect, just like when [Warhead] > [InfDeath=0](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) is set without defining [Infantry] > DeathAnims=.

  If [InfDeath=16](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) or more, then it will use the first entry in the list defined by [Infantry] > DeathAnims=.

  If the index number specified by [InfDeath](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) + 1 is greater than the actual number of entries owned by [Infantry] > DeathAnims=, that is, there is no corresponding item
  (including the case where [InfDeath=15](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) but the [Infantry] > DeathAnims list does not have 16 Animations written),
  then the first item of [Infantry] > DeathAnims= will be used in the same way.
  If you include a comma before any other animation, will make the animation next to it will be considered an animation that died from [InfDeath=1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) always
  Example:
  DeathAnims=,,,S_BANG34,FLAMEGUY,ELECTRO,YURIDIE

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Please note that!!!
  Because DeathAnims can only fill in Animations, the corresponding animation will also be played for InfDeath1 and InfDeath2, instead of [InfantrySequence] > Die1=<sequence> and Die2=<sequence>

  - Of course, you can solved this problem by using [MakeInfantry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MakeInfantry) to make another infantry die together with the original infantry.The effect looks good.(See the fourth item in See also for details)

  DeathAnims has some other effects:

  - First, you can add death animation without any extension patch, such as [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares).
  - For [InfDeath=5](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath), the old theory was that the game would always use the second one in the [Animations] list, rather than using statements like [General] > [InfantryNuked=<animation>](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryNuked) (unless you use Ares.  Ares can allow you to use the [AudioVisual] > [InfantryElectrocuted=<animation>](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryElectrocuted)).

  However, if you use DeathAnims, it will normally use the sixth item in this list instead of the second item in the [Animations] list, that is, you can define ElectrocutedDeath through DeathAnims!

  - With my great effort, any infantry death from any warhead with [InfDeath=8](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) can be remapped correctly by faction.

  Without changing the animation in the [InfantryVirus](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryVirus) section, such as InfantryVirus=GENDEATH1

  Use DeathAnims to assign death patterns to infantry+my efforts.

  When an infantryman dies So I know Infantry mutations always use [InfDeath=9](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath)(GENDEATH) ignoring mutations from [InfDeath=8](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath)(GENDEATH2).

  This is because infantry can remap colors correctly. Regardless of infantry death from weapons with [InfDeath=9](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfDeath) from any party Brute caused by mutation It will always belong to that side.

  (My infantry (green) uses mutated weapons. Kill the Red Army soldiers. "Brute" caused by killing By the skill of the Green Army soldiers. will always belong to the red side)

  - The animations generated by DeathAnims all have their owner. They can remap their owner colors like InfDeath9, and generate BRUTE with their owner House.
  However, DeathAnims will use the owner of the dead Infantry, that is, the Infantry you generate through DeathAnims belongs to the original owner of the dead Infantry, so it cannot complete replace the original InfDeath9. Of course, maybe this is just right to meet your design needs.
  If you use [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares), you can add [MakeInfantryOwner=killer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MakeInfantryOwner) on animation to solve this problem, so that the generated infantrytype belongs to the house of the killer.

Cyborg="""
  Defines whether an infantry will behave like a cyborg, rather than a normal soldier.

  ## Notes

  This includes the loss of its legs when the cyborg is damaged heavily. During this process it regains 25% of its health, but it can only crawl from now on. The cyborg uses the prone sequence variants to create this effect.

  Once a cyborg is crawling it can still be repaired back to full health, though its legs stay lost. Destroying a crawling cyborg finally kills it.

  Damaging or destroying a cyborg displays the `[General]`→[InfantryExplode=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryExplode) animation.

  If `[CombatDamage]`→[BerzerkAllowed=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BerzerkAllowed) is set, the cyborg can go berzerk if it is damaged. In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) the berzerk ability is not working, however, through AI Scripting, this can be re-enabled (see [ScriptActions#2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ScriptActions#2) for more info).

  Cyborg logic does not work well together with deployable infantry, because the cyborg uses its prone status to indicate it has no legs and deploying and undeploying clears this.

  Cyborg logic does not work well with transport vehicles, because the cyborg uses its prone status to indicate that it has no legs, but entering and exiting a transport will clear this status.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Such infantry will ignore the prone process specified by [Down=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Down) in its sequence and directly enter crawl behavior.

  ## Notes

  In fact, DeployedCrushable and Crushable are only related to [Crusher=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Crusher), and have nothing to do with OmniCrusher=yes and OmniCrushResistant=yes. You can refer to the [Who crushes whom](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Who_crushes_whom) rule for details[1].

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  DeployedCrushable=no only takes effect when Crushable=yes.

  - Even if DeployedCrushable=yes, if Crushable=no, then regardless of whether the Infantry is in a deployed state, it cannot be crushed by only having [Crusher=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Crusher).

ChainReaction="""
  Whether this overlay explodes violently when being damaged. This is not to be confused with [TiberiumChainReaction](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TiberiumChainReaction) on Animations.

  The chain reaction effect described below is not working in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), because the functions have been removed. Only minor parts of the logic remain.

  The effect is triggered in the following three cases:

  - Terrain objects with [SpawnsTiberium=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpawnsTiberium) are destroyed
  - Wave weapons deal ambient damage
  - A warhead deals damage to the cell. If the overlay has [Tiberium=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberium) set, the warhead also must have Tiberium=yes set.

  In the latter case, the cell's Tiberium grow stage is also reduced by Damage/10 after the effect. This is the only effect ChainReaction has in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and later.

  ## The Effect

  If the cell's Tiberium grow stage is larger than 1 (of 12 grow steps for the three growing Tiberium types), there's a Grow Stage * 5% chance that it will react. Otherwise, none of the following happens.

  The cell's Tiberium grow stage is halved. The number of grow stages removed by this (the other half) is multiplied by the Tiberium's [Power](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Power), which constitutes the damage to deal. [C4Warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/C4Warhead) is used to deliver the damage, and the explosion animation is selected from its AnimList. Up to 6 animation indexes are selected from the list, with higher the [Power](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Power) values resulting in higher indexes. The animation selected from this range depends on the grow stage of the Tiberium patch, with more mature patches using higher animation indexes.

  Below is the formula for determining the exact animation:

  C4WarheadAnimListindex [1-based] = trunc(((trunc(Tiberium grow stage [frame, 1-based] / 2) ×Power) × 4) / 25) + 1
  Each of the cell's eight surrounding cells that have any Tiberium type on them with a growth stage of more than 2 has an 80% probability to get hit with an animation of type INVISO, with a random delay between 15 and 120 frames (1 to 8 seconds on default speed).

  If an overlay with this value set to `yes` also has [Wall=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall), then weapons with [TerrainFire=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TerrainFire) will automatically gain the `Attack` cursor on it, regardless of whether the user of the weapon is hostile to the owner of the wall.

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Warning_small.png) Note that the particle system `[GasCloudSys]` must not have a limited Lifetime [else the game will crash](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_005A59B4) when that system is created.

  - Just like [MaxEC](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MaxEC), the cooldown for the weapon associated with this must also meet both conditions: the elapsing of the frames specified by [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF) and the disappearance of the particle.

  ## Notes

  The particle will move directionally towards the orientation defined by `[General]`→[WindDirection=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WindDirection) only when this value is > 0.

  The interval/cycle for directional movement is `(10 / WindEffect)` frames, calculated based on game frames using the following formula:

  As an int value this is rounded down, so the actual relationship between values and cycles is as follows:

  WindEffectMoving interval (in frames)110253 - 526 - 101 (every frame)
  Gas-type particles inherently have a random-direction drift speed (max value 2) that operates additively with this effect. Therefore, even if set to 0 or negative values (unaffected by this effect), particles will still move.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  ## Notes

  The initial launch direction is upwards.

  This is a sub weapon, so it needs to be used by a unit. Of course, you can directly use the `[WeaponTypes]` registry introduced by [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares).

  In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), the vertically moving nuclear missile actually launches a projectile with [Vertical=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical). Due to the initial direction, it flies perpendicular to the ground upwards. For specific details, see the [NukeMaker](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NukeMaker) page.

  For projectiles with [Arcing=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Arcing), they do not fly straight like Vertical ones. Therefore, even if the initial angle is perpendicular to the ground, they will fall vertically after a period determined by `[AudioVisual]`→[Gravity=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Gravity) and hit the silo.

  For projectiles with [ROT=1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROT) (or higher), although the initial direction is upward, if they have [CourseLockDuration](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CourseLockDuration) set, due to the related coding behavior, after a certain time they will deflect towards the northwest (top-left of the screen).

The super weapon's own [RechargeTime](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/RechargeTime) determines how long it takes to recharge completely, and `[General]`→[ChargeToDrainRatio=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ChargeToDrainRatio) is a multiplier to that charge time used to calculate how long it will take the super weapon to drain its charge completely.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This flag was designed for the Type=Firestorm super weapon and has a lot of hardcoded behaviour related to it. As such, it is not advised to use this flag on other SuperWeaponTypes. For example, using this flag on the Iron Curtain super weapon would allow the owner to fire the Iron Curtain many times during the discharge period, because at no point does firing an Iron Curtain count as switching it off.

  ## Trivia

  Some modders may attempt to create multiple [Type=LightningStorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Type) or Type=PsychicDominator super weapons that can be launched simultaneously through the effects mentioned in the #Bugs section. However, their conflict behavior is actually controlled by global variables, and whether it's UseChargeDrain=yes or other release methods in engine extension projects like [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) that can skip relevant checks, they cannot truly achieve parallel release of multiple instances of these two types of super weapons.

  - For example, a Type=PsychicDominator superweapon, even if it bypasses conflict restrictions and is forced to release, only continuously updates the final launch location rather than creating an additional complete [SuperWeaponType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SuperWeaponType) instance. The same applies to Type=LightningStorm; they only continuously update the location within the original release cycle, and after the location is updated, independent lightning will no longer be created near the old location.
  - Furthermore, UseChargeDrain=yes only allows the same SuperWeaponType to be released again within the effective duration, but for these two types of super weapons, when releasing, the check on other SuperWeaponTypes that use the same Type`=` value will not be skipped. That is to say, you cannot use it to achieve the release of two SuperWeaponTypes with the same Type=LightningStorm during each other's release period.

  ## Notes

  In multiplayer mode, when players open crates of `Unit` CrateType, there are other judgment rules[1] that occur before random behavior.

  - First is the [FreeMCV](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FreeMCV) rule, and it is hard-coded to take effect in vanilla and does not follow the ini flag.
  - Second, if the player has any building(s) listed in `[AI]`→[BuildRefinery=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildRefinery) but has no vehicles listed in `[General]`→[HarvesterUnit=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/HarvesterUnit), a [harvester](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Harvester) unit from the HarvesterUnit list will be granted at this time.
  - Next is the judgment for UnitCrateType. If it is set, then the filled object will be used directly. This flag is used to add the vehicle to the random pool when `[CrateRules]`→[UnitCrateType=none](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnitCrateType).

  At this point, it finally reaches the step of random selection. After selection is completed, it is filtered based on whether CrateGoodie=yes is satisfied[2], that is, it reaches the step controlled by this flag. However, this is not the end:

  - If the drawn vehicle is not in [BaseUnit=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BaseUnit), then it is used directly;
  - If the drawn vehicle is listed in BaseUnit`=`, then an additional check is performed. If owner is not a Human Player[3] and the current NeedBase check of the FreeMCV rule is not satisfied, then it will return to the random selection step to draw a new object.

  Should not set CrateGoodie=yes for units that cannot move on land, such as naval ships. Otherwise, they will spawn to the nearest [Land=water](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandType) cell (including those where [NoUseTileLandType=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NoUseTileLandType) is not set and that are occupied by [Land=water](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Land) overlays) or under the overhanging bridge body of an elevated bridge.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  A loop that cannot be fully broken out of with a break statement is used in the random selection process. This means that if the process normally enters random selection but there is no vehicle with CrateGoodie=yes, or if in the step to prevent AI from acquiring BaseUnit, it repeatedly fails to select any vehicle that is not a BaseUnit, it will cause an infinite loop, leading to game freeze.

  ## Footnotes

  - ↑ Here, we temporarily do not consider situations such as when there are already `50` vehicles, it will be forced to switch to [Money](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Money#In_[Powerups]) CrateType, etc., due to Crate behavior leading to other non-Unit branches.
  - ↑ Yes, the selection is not only performed among objects with CrateGoodie=yes, but rather the selection is completed first, and then filtered through CrateGoodie=yes.
  - ↑ [Westwood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Westwood) attempts to prevent AI from having multiple bases in this way, perhaps hoping to avoid [AI Factories Clone](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AllowParallelAIQueues).

DeployToFire="""
  If set on a vehicle, the vehicle will never fire its weapons. Instead, when acquiring a target, it will approach that target until it is within range of that weapon from its attached weapons that would use against that target and then, instead of firing that weapon, deploy into the structure defined by its [DeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeploysInto) statement. Alternatively, if it [IsSimpleDeployer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsSimpleDeployer), it will simple-deploy, becoming stationary and changing to its [UnloadingClass](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnloadingClass), before firing its weapon.

  ## Notes

  - It appears that vehicles on which this flag is set will also never autonomously acquire a target to attack. They will only acquire a target when retaliating against an attacker who is within the range of the weapon that they would use against that attacker, or when ordered to attack by the owning player/house.
  - It is possible to give a building weapons that are entirely different from those of the vehicle it deploys from (or no weapons at all), which means that after transforming into a building, it may no longer have the necessary range, projectile characteristics or warhead to actually attack the target that it had acquired before deploying. This does not cause any errors or glitches and the building will simply 'forget' the attack command against that target.
  - If a unit that has to DeployToFire is on a cell that does not allow the placement of the structure that the unit deploys into (for example because the cell holds ore) and the unit then acquires a target, it will look for nearby clear cells that it can deploy in, move there and then deploy. This is in contrast with the manual Deploy order, which simply fails to function if a unit is on a cell in which it cannot deploy.
  At least this happens if there are any clear cells from which its intended target would still be within range of its current weapon. It is uncertain what happens if no such cells are available.
  If the target moves out of range of the intended cell while the unit is still en-route to deploy there, it seems to move to that cell regardless, and deploy there. (Unconfirmed)

If specified, the unit will be able to fire its' DeployFireWeapon normally when deployed. If a vehicle only has [DeployFire](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployFire), it will fire its' DeployFireWeapon directly at the ground underneath itself when deployed (although the weapon can also be fired at other targets by the unit's owner).

  The game will also play [DeployingAnim](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployingAnim) when the unit is ordered to deploy or undeploy. Units which only have DeployFire will simply fire at the ground at their position when deployed and can be aimed at other targets and ordered to move as any other unit, while units which have IsSimpleDeployer will also be unable to move in this form, until ordered to deploy again.

  ## Notes

  - If the unit is [JumpJet=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpJet) and has [DeployToLand=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployToLand) set, it will first turn to face the direction specified by `[AudioVisual]`→[PoseDir=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PoseDir), and land to deploy only after.
  - If the original vehicle has [Turret=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret), but the [UnloadingClass](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnloadingClass) does not, the game will still try to look for a turret graphic corresponding to the UnloadingClass image when the unit deploys, and will use an invisible turret if it doesn't find one.
  - If the original vehicle has [Turret=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret), but the [UnloadingClass](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UnloadingClass) has [Turret=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret), the turret image corresponding to the UnloadingClass image will still get loaded, but the unit itself will turn to face the target, with the turret fixed facing the same direction as the unit.

  The above problem can be solved by adding tags. [MovementRestrictedTo=Water](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MovementRestrictedTo) for [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes) that can fly.

  But the disadvantage [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes) is that it cannot use logic IsSimpleDeployer and [DeployToLand=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployToLand) so it's no different than not using the IsSimpleDeployer and [DeployToLand=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployToLand) tag even if it is added.[](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Siege_Chopper1.gif)Siege Chopper and IsSimpleDeployer=yes,[BalloonHover=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BalloonHover),[DeployToLand=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployToLand),[MovementRestrictedTo=Water](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MovementRestrictedTo),[JumpjetHeight=500](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpjetHeight)(Original)

  - This means that the unit will not spawn a crate if the map has TruckCrate=no (TrainCrate=no in case of trains).

  ## Notes

  A particularly evident key point is: The logic can only create a crate when the game has the Crates option enabled.

  - For singleplayer missions, this requires setting `[MultiplayerDialogSettings]`→[Crates=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Crates).
  - If you use the cncnet-spawner (YR extension), then make sure that `[Settings]`→Crates=yes in `spawn.ini`[1].

  The crate will contain a random powerup;

  - In [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun)'s singleplayer missions, the powerup is determined by `[CrateRules]`→[WoodCrate=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WoodCrate).

  - [Shape-based](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SHP) vehicle units' firing sequences are played in reverse relative to the normal frame order, i.e. from the highest firing frame index to lowest firing frame index. However, this flag is calculated in the opposite (normal) direction, from lowest frame index to highest frame index. In other words, higher values mean the weapon is fired sooner.

  - Every firing frame lasts for two time frames.

  ## Example

  Suppose that a unit has a firing sequence that consists of eight frames (FiringFrames=8). If you want the unit to fire its weapon right away, you would use FiringSyncFrame1=15. If you want the unit to fire its weapon at the end of the firing sequence, you would use FiringSyncFrame1=0.

"""
BurstDelay3="""
  Weapons that have a [Burst](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Burst) greater than 1 fire that many times at short intervals (as opposed to firing them simultaneously). The delay between each burst shot is randomly selected from a range of 3–5 [frames](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Frames). BurstDelayX can be used to override this delay (in FS, this is a per-weapon property, in YR it has been turned into a per-unit one).

  The X should be substituted with an [integer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Help:Values#Integers) between 0 and Burst−2 (the game will only parse X from 0 to 3 inclusive). For example, if X is 0, the value represents the time in frames between the first and the second burst shots.

  ## In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge)

  If any BurstDelay is omitted, it will inherit the value of the first numerically preceding one.

  For example, if Burst=3, BurstDelay0=5, and BurstDelay1 is not defined, it will inherit the value of BurstDelay0, which is 5. In other words, each burst shot will fire in 5 frame intervals.

  In a slightly more complex example, if Burst=5 and BurstDelay2=10 (other BurstDelayX's are not defined), burst shots 1 through 3 will fire in 1 frame intervals (the default behavior), however burst shots 4 and 5 will fire 10 frames after the preceding shot.

  ## Notes

  - Setting BurstDelay=0 will remove any delay, allowing the bursts to be fired on consecutive frames.
  - Interacts differently with unit [shape](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SHP) animations depending on the unit type:
  On [infantry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes), the firing animation sequence ([FireUp](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FireUp), [FireProne](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=FireProne&action=edit&redlink=1), etc.) overrides BurstDelay.

AltImage="""
  Define an alternative image for a Visceroid-type unit when performing an attack

  ## Notes

  This image executes a program-internal sequence, thus it can work even without an image definition section in [art(fs).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Art.ini), just like `VISLGATK` in [Tiberian Sun](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Tiberian_Sun).

  Although [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) restored the Visceroid-related logic in version 0.5, it does not include this set of hard-coded rules related to AltImage.

  - However, you could already define an attacking 'image' (frames) for a VehicleType through the conventional [FiringFrames](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FiringFrames) scheme.

  ## Trivia

  For images related to Visceroid, the only customizable flag is this one, and all images are not defined in `art(fs).ini`. Although the [Image=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Image) flag controlling regular images is read, the program internally redefines the images for the regular state at `0x6530BB` (v2.03), for [small Visceroid](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SmallVisceroid) using `VISC_SML.SHP` and for [large Visceroid](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LargeVisceroid) using `VISC_LRG.SHP`.

  ## VoxelAnims' method of acquiring images

  According to the following sequence, obtain and use one of body, turret, or barl as an image. If it is already satisfied, then directly break out and no longer continue checking.

  - If [ShareBodyData=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShareBodyData) is set, then it will use the techno's main (body) voxel.
  - Otherwise, if [ShareTurretData=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShareTurretData) is set, it will use the techno's turret voxel.
  - Otherwise, if [ShareBarrelData=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShareBarrelData) is set, it will use the techno's barrel voxel.

  - Otherwise, if [Image=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Image) is set, it will use the image specified by Image`=`.
  - Otherwise, it will use the image with the same name as the section.

  - For the latter two cases, images obtained via ShareSource`=` will not be used.

  ## Notes

  If this TechnoType itself uses Image`=` to specify an image in [rules(md).ini](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rules.ini), then ShareSource will get the redirected image.

  - For example, if ShareSource=DTRUCK, it will actually use the image specified by `[DTRUCK]`'s Image, which is `[TRUCKA]`.

  ShareTurretData and ShareBarrelData do not check whether this TechnoType actually has [Turret=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Turret); they are called based on file naming conventions.

  - That is to say, even for technos without a turret like `[V3ROCKET]`, they can still normally call the `V3ROCKETBARL.VXL` and `V3ROCKETBARL.HVA` files.

  Failure to obtain an image through SourceData will not cause a game crash, but if an non-existent image is specified through Image`=`, it will cause [EIP#007564BD](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_007564BD).

[WarheadType]
CellSpread="""
  `CellSpread` defines the blast radius of a [Warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warheads), and without it, a warhead only affects the exact [cell](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cell) it impacts/targets.

  As the distance increases from the point of impact, [PercentAtMax](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PercentAtMax) determines how quickly the blast damage weakens, or how much of the initial damage a unit at a certain distance from the point of impact receives.

  ## Traditional View

  For a quick, simple understanding of `CellSpread`, simply view it as follows: The damage will extend beyond the impact cell for as many cells as `CellSpread` is set to. e.g. if you set `CellSpread` to 3, the warhead will damage the current cell, and 3 cells further into all directions. A circle around the impact cell with a radius of 3, for a diameter of 6.
  The image to the right reflects which cells are affected by which `CellSpread` under this simple model of `CellSpread`.

  ## Reality

  Areas affected by particularCellSpreadvalues.
  Order in which potentialCellSpread-affected cells are scanned.
  In reality, the game's parsing of `CellSpread` is performed slightly differently:

  - If the warhead was detonated at least 1 lepton above the cell surface, air units get affected:
  The game divides the map area into a 20x20 grid at map load, and each unit using the Fly, Jumpjet or Rocket [Locomotor](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor)s is tracked all through its lifetime to know which "sector" of the grid it's in.
  When it's time to deliver damage, the game consults the grid to find such units within range (the exact rules for what counts as "within range" in this case are still being determined, but this appears to use the rough cell-based distance model rather than the precise lepton based one).
  For each found unit, the unit and its distance to the epicenter are added to the list of potential damage recipients.

    - For each found unit, the unit and its distance to the epicenter are added to the list of potential damage recipients.
  - The game adds 0.99 to the CellSpread and drops the fractional part (in other words, it gets rounded to the next-highest integer, e.g. CellSpread=3.25 is turned into 3.25 + 0.99 = 4.24 = 4).
  - It then finds all cells associated with that value in the CellSpread lookup table.

  If the final distance is less or equal to exact CellSpread * 256, the object gets damaged. (256 is the number of leptons per cell, and this calculation uses the original, set CellSpread, not the rounded value.)

  The practical difference to the traditional view of `CellSpread` is mostly the handling of "diagonal" damage. As visible in the image in the section above, the traditional model assumes the corner cells to belong to the next-higher cell spread, when, in reality, the map's cells are irrelevant in the distance calculation. That means that damage does indeed spread in a perfect sphere radius, making working with it a lot easier.
  In addition, as visible in the visual representation, since the damage spreads in leptons from the point of impact, rather than in cells from the cell of impact, the cells in the outer-most ring of a given damage area are not affected completely when using integer values; e.g. a CellSpread of 1 does not actually damage the entirety of the first cell next to the target, but only half of it. In order to damage the entire next cell, one would have to choose a value of roughly 1.5.
  Furthermore, since InfantryTypes can stand in various places inside a cell, if they are hit by CellSpread-warheads, the point from which the game calculates the distance to determine whether an object is affected by the CellSpread is not necessarily the center of the impacted cell, potentially changing the affected parts of the outer ring again.

  The distance itself is calculated in all three dimensions, meaning a flying unit can be affected by `CellSpread` in the same way all other units can. Note that the flying units within the affected cells can be damaged at higher altitudes than one would expect, but that doesn't mean the flyers in the neighbouring cells are affected.

PercentAtMax="""
  This tag defines the multiplier to damage at the far-end of a [Warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead)'s [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread). For objects in between the point of impact, and the CellSpread, the damage is adjusted linearly using this value.

  ## Formula

  To understand how damage is distributed across the cells, refer to the below formula:

  M = 1 - (1 - P) × (D / S)
  **where,**: M is the multiplier to damage. This is the value used to adjust the final damage.

  ## Examples

  Let's say there are 4 units around the target area - A is at the dead center of impact, B is 1 cell away, C is 3 cells away, and D is 5 cells away.

  [Warhead1]
  CellSpread=5.0
  PercentAtMax=1.0
  In this instance, using the above formula gives us a multiplier of 100% for A, B, C, and D.

  Now take the same 4 units, and the warhead below:

  [Warhead2]
  CellSpread=7.0
  PercentAtMax=0.02

  ## Against Buildings

  When a building is damaged into [red health](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConditionRed) by a Sparky=yes warhead, then it will randomly spawn animations from the OnFire list. The animations are attached to the building.

  For each cell of the building's foundation, a random number from `0` to `Foundation Width + Foundation Height + 5` is picked. Depending on this number, an animation is created in the cell. This means that the probability for each cell gets smaller the bigger the building is, and that small buildings will not create some types of animation.

  - `1` to `5` create the first item in the OnFire list.
  - `6` to `8` create the second item in the OnFire list.
  - `9` creates the third item in the OnFire list.
  - Any other number creates no animation.

  ## Against Terrain Objects (Starting Forest Fires)

  Sparky=yes warheads are part of the forest fire logic and can ignite trees.

  Any Armor=wood and SpawnsTiberium=no terrain object hit by a Sparky=yes and [Wood=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wood) warhead with positive damage can be ignited. Either the first or the second item from the TreeFire list is spawned randomly and attached to the terrain object. When the animation finishes playing and no other animations are attached to the burning terrain object, it extinguishes.

  While the tree is burning, it can ignite trees nearby and create a forest fire. See [TreeFlammability](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TreeFlammability).

  Forest Fires is not available in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge).

  ## Notes

  This logic only takes effect when directly targeting a vehicle.

  - As long as the target is a vehicle, the projectile will affect it upon detonation regardless of where it explodes, similarly to [Temporal](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Temporal).

  Just like the regular [Rocker=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rocker), the force of the flip is determined by the [Damage=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) value on the weapon.

  - However, here during the flip, it is also multiplied by the coefficient from `[AudioVisual]`→[DirectRockingCoefficient=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DirectRockingCoefficient).
  - And after stopping, the fallback speed is also multiplied by the coefficient from `[AudioVisual]`→[FallBackCoefficient=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FallBackCoefficient).

  Vehicles equipped with this warhead can only initiate one attack.

  - The vehicle(s) with [Pushy=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Pushy) among the attacking vehicle and the target vehicle (or both, if both have it) will be unable to perform any attack actions thereafter, until one is destroyed or performs an action like [DeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeploysInto) that removes itself from the field, although the cursor will still display normally.
  - The vehicle(s) without Pushy=yes among the attacking vehicle and the target vehicle (or both, if both have it) will also be incapable of movement actions because the cursor over open ground will always display as `Default` and over objects as `NoMove`, making it impossible for them to even attempt such actions.

  Should this single attack fail to overturn the target vehicle, both parties will remain in this immobilized state until external forces destroy one of them.

  - Although infantry is not restricted to firing only once, unless a Stop command is manually issued, during the duration when the effect is active, the cursor on open ground will display as `NoMove`, meaning it cannot move.

  Since this is a persistent effect that begins for the firer upon firing and for the target vehicle upon being hit, [FireOnce](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FireOnce) will not interrupt it. Even for infantry—who can fire continuously rather than just once—this only manifests as a cessation of firing. The flip effect will continue and stack at intervals based on the weapon's [ROF](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ROF), as if the weapon were still firing.

  Such a warhead can even flip over vehicles with [Locomotor={92612C46-F71F-11d1-AC9F-006008055BB5}](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Jumpjet) (Jumpjet) and Voxel resource files, but without [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos)' fix, it won't have a visual representation due to the locomotor's own limitations.

AnimList="""
  The list of animations created when this warhead explodes, with the creation rules as follows:

  AnimList can accept any number[1] of animations. The game will pick which one to show through the damage delivered by the projectile. This is usually the weapon's [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) multiplied by the [Firepower](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firepower) multiplier of the owner house, and any firepower upgrades the firing unit might have. The animation is acquired by dividing this delivered damage by 25[2] and truncating the result.

  For example, up to 24 damage, the first animation in the list will be played. From 25 to 49 damage, the second animation. From 50 to 74 damage, third animation in the list will be played, and so on. When the damage value exceeds the available animation slots in the list, then the last animation in the list is played.

  ## Notes

  There are some special cases where this zero-based index logic is ignored:

  - If the warhead has [EMEffect=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EMEffect), then it will pick an animation at random.
  - If the warhead is defined in `[CombatDamage]`→[C4Warhead=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/C4Warhead), the last animation is played for crashing aircraft.

  In addition, if the warhead has [Conventional=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Conventional) set, and the projectile hits [water](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LandTypes), the animations defined by the `[AudioVisual]`→[SplashList=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SplashList) statement are used instead.

  - If it hits a non-underwater unit in a Water cell, then it will be considered as exploding on land. If you want to define it, refer to the documents mentioned in #References.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If through AnimList an explosion animation is set for a warhead that uses negative [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage), then it will trigger [EIP#00422131](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_00422131).

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.2.

  If the warhead is defined in `[General]`→[LightningWarhead=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LightningWarhead), then the animation will be the one defined in `[General]`→[WeatherConBoltExplosion=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/WeatherConBoltExplosion) regardless.

  The animation created in this way has its Z-depth hard-coded to `-15`.

  - As of [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build49, this can now be customized. See here.

  If the target infantry is using the [Paradrop](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Paradrop) sequence, then enforce the behavior of InfDeath=3.

  If the kill comes from a [LaserFence](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserFence) type building, then enforce the behavior of InfDeath=5.

  #8
  InfDeath=8 (Virus death) assumes the animation for it has a [SpawnsParticle](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpawnsParticle) set and will always try to spawn a particle - you can't make it skip this part. SpawnsParticle has a volatile default value, which means forgetting to set it to a valid particle on this animation will cause an IE or erratic behaviour.

  Additionally, inflicting this on a [NotHuman=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NotHuman) (this effect does happen even though NotHuman should prevent it) or an airborne object spawns just one particle from SpawnsParticle, as opposed to normal behaviour (which is to spawn [NumParticles](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NumParticles)).

  #9
  InfDeath=9 (Genetic Mutator death) is hardcoded not to deal any damage to infantry that are not firmly on the ground (paratroopers), as well as not to play its animation if affecting an airborne object. In these cases, for lethal shots (which don't really happen given that damage isn't dealt, but that's how the game is coded) sub-sequence Die2 is forced instead.

  ## Spawning

  In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), these death animations can be made to spawn a player-owned [InfantryType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryType) via the [MakeInfantry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MakeInfantry) logic:

  - InfDeath=8, `InfantryVirus`, can be displayed in the unit palette if [AltPalette=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AltPalette), however remappable colors will not acquire the correct player colour.

  - InfDeath=9, `InfantryMutate`, is [hardcoded](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Hardcoded) to use the unit palette and will be remapped to the correct player colour.

  All other InfDeath animations, besides those that are part of an infantry [Sequence](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Sequence), can be made to spawn a neutral-owned InfantryType. These can be displayed in the unit palette if [AltPalette=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AltPalette), however remappable colors will not acquire the correct player colour.

  ## With [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares)

  Ares restored this feature and made logical adaptations for the newly added content in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge). However, the time calculation no longer uses the above algorithm; instead, it uses dual control of [EMP.Duration](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EMP.Duration) and [EMP.Cap](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EMP.Cap).

  EMP disables susceptible units and buildings along with their special functions and makes them vulnerable to attacks. EMP can affect units and buildings in various ways:

  - Primary effect: units will not respond to any commands. They will stop moving and will not attack anything.
  - [Hovering](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Hover) units (such as the Hover MLRS and Robot Tank) will land.
  - Units display an optional sparkles animation defined by `[AudioVisual]`→[EMPulseSparkles=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EMPulseSparkles) or [EMP.Sparkles=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/EMP.Sparkles).
  - [Voxel-based](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Voxel) units are darkened ([SHP-based](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Shape) units are not).
  - Buildings that can undeploy into vehicles (e.g. [MCVs](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MCV)) still can, but the resulting vehicle will remain deactivated until the effect wears off.
  - Aircraft will immediately crash.
  - Power plants ([Power](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Power#On_BuildingTypes)`>0`) cease to produce power.
  - [Factories](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Factory) will stop working.
  - Base defenses will not be able to fire their weapon.
  - [Gap Generators](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/GapGenerator) will stop emitting radar gap.
  - [Laser Fence Posts](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserFencePost) will stop emitting laser fences.
  - [Robot Control Centers](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PowersUnit) will stop working.
  - Super weapon buildings will shut down and the super weapons themselves will stop charging, if they have `[SuperWeaponType]`→[IsPowered=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsPowered) set.
  - [Radar buildings](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Radar) will stop providing radar.
  - [SpySat buildings](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpySat) will stop to reveal the map.
  - [Units that spawn other units](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Spawns) will cease to do so. If the spawner unit has launched any aircraft then the aircraft will immediately crash.
  - [Slave Miner](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Enslaves) slaves will stop working.
  - Units that are in their unloading state (such as ore harvesters depositing ore or Siege Choppers [transforming](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsSimpleDeployer)) will only become deactivated once they have finished unloading.
  - [Harvesters](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Harvester) that were in the middle of harvesting when hit by EMP will resume harvesting after EMP wears off.

  ## Notes

  Infantry are by default immune to EMP, except those with [Cyborg=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Cyborg). However, some keys introduced in [Firestorm](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Firestorm) allow for immunity to EMP on vehicles, such as [IsCoreDefender=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsCoreDefender).

  ## References

  Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#13, this allows using a new flag to achieve random selection of animations listed in [AnimList=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AnimList), thereby avoiding the side effects of EMEffect=yes.

MindControl="""
  If set, this warhead will mind-control the target instead of inflicting damage. The effect is instant, and ignores whether the weapon actually hit the target or not. Objects that have [ImmuneToPsionics=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ImmuneToPsionics) are completely immune, and cannot be targeted.

  Normally, the owner can only target and control one object at a time, and will lose control over the first target if it fires on a second one. In YR this logic was extended to allow multiple units to be mind-controlled at once for the Mastermind, see below.

  ## In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2)

  [Infantry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) under mind-control cannot garrison buildings, the [Occupier=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Occupier) tag is rendered inert. This behaviour does not affect [Spy](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Agent) or [Engineer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Engineer) units, as those units are destroyed upon entry into their target buildings.

  ## In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge)

  The [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) value of the [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) weapon determines how many objects total can be controlled by the firer, the Damage value of [ElitePrimary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ElitePrimary) is ignored even when promoted to Elite.

  Values greater than 1 prevent previously established mind-control links from being lost. After reaching the control limit, no new object can be mind-controlled until at least one of the old ones is destroyed, except in the case that [InfiniteMindControl=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfiniteMindControl) is also set on the warhead.

  ## Notes

  If a mind-controlled unit is released from control while its original owning house has been defeated, the unit will be transferred to the neutral side. If the unit is an [MCV](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BaseUnit), it will often proceed to [EIP#00505E41](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_00505E41).

  Since [buildings](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) have ImmuneToPsionics=yes by default, they require manual setting of ImmuneToPsionics=no to be mind-controllable.

  - In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), the mechanism allowing Yuri Prime to mind-control buildings is achieved not only by setting [Verses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses) to non-zero but also by extensively adding ImmuneToPsionics=no to buildings.
  These elements are absent in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), thus requiring modders to implement them manually.
    - These elements are absent in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), thus requiring modders to implement them manually.

  A new check was added in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge): the [Insignificant=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Insignificant) attribute on the target unit only influences the shooter's target selection when the unit is not under mind control[1].

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  Since the Mind Control Warhead operates in a one-to-one manner, it does not support the use of [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread) and Sub-weapon[2]

  Whether a weapon can possess mind control capability and the quantity it can control entirely depends on whether the Primary weapon's warhead of the firing entity has MindControl=yes and the Damage value of the Primary weapon.

  - For example, if the Secondary warhead has MindControl=yes while the Primary warhead does not, or if the occupied unit's [OccupyWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OccupyWeapon) weapon's warhead has MindControl=yes while the occupying structure's Primary weapon's warhead does not, this will trigger [EIP#00471CA4](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_00471CA4).

  In [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), MindControl-parasites would draw a mind-control link between the mind-controlled unit and the point on the map where the parasite entered the unit.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) 0.1.

  MindControl and [DeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeploysInto)/[UndeploysInto](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UndeploysInto) interact poorly; the latter's type conversion severs the mind control link, causing TechnoType to permanently change owners. This is particularly evident in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) 1.000 with MCV and Construction Yard. When they are mind-controlled by Yuri Prime and perform deploy/undeploy, then Yuri Prime's owner will obtain an object for free that does not count towards the mind control limit.

  - To address this issue, [Westwood](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Westwood) added a check in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge) 1.001 for [ConstructionYard=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ConstructionYard) on BuildingType that is the target of convert, in order to prevent mind-controlled VehicleType (MCVs) from deploying into such buildings, and vice versa.
  - Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#1, the mind control link is properly transferred during such type conversions instead of being severed.

IvanBomb="""
  If IvanBomb=yes is set on a warhead it will tell the game that the warhead is for Crazy Ivan's dynamite weapon, and so should attach timed dynamite to the target object rather than acting like a normal warhead.

  If a unit is 'hit' by such a warhead it will not recognise that it has been hit and so will not retaliate (in the same way that the Spy's disguise-picker does not cause enemy targets to retaliate).

  Determine whether to use a charged warhead.

  ## Notes

  Such warheads can have the following effects on buildings with [Overpowerable=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Overpowerable):

  - If in LowPower state, maintaining two such warheads charging simultaneously can keep it operational.
  - If already operational, adding one more charged warhead will allow it to switch from [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) to [Secondary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) when attacking ground targets.
  - Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#47, the levels required for these two behaviors can be customized on the building; the level provided by a warhead can also be customized on the warhead itself. Refer to the Phobos documentation.

  Normally, units will only actively search for buildings on adjacent cells and then charge. However, if such infantry is firing in transport units with [OpenTopped=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpenTopped), then the transport unit will stop charging only when the distance to the building exceeds the weapon's range.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  This only has the above effect when launched by infantry.

  - [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) expanded this logic, allowing it to take effect even when launched by vehicles.

  This feature does not check whether the units can actually attack the target building. That is to say, even [Verses=0%](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses), it will still attempt to attack. However, since it cannot actually attack, it gets stuck at the step of initiating the attack action and keeps trying repeatedly.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#48.
"""
Parasite="""
  Specifies whether or not the firer themselves will physically enter the target on warhead impact, to cause its effects from within. This effect is used on the Terror Drone in conjunction with [LimboLaunch=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LimboLaunch) ("become the bullet") to give the appearance of the Drone jumping inside a vehicle and dismantling it from the inside.

  Parasites are, of course, protected whilst they are inside a target as they cannot be hit by conventional weapons (their 'host' is hit instead). However, [Sonic=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Sonic) weapons will evict a parasite from its target.
  Repair Depots and Repair IFVs will instantly eliminate any parasite contained within the vehicle being repaired.

  Setting Parasite=yes will make the infested target rock and produce sparks, even if [Rocker=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rocker) is set (however if you set Rocker=yes then the weapon damage will be dealt with each rock of the target rather than over time).

  If the parasite destroys the target then it will emerge, unscathed, however if the target is destroyed by another weapon whilst the parasite is inside then the parasite will be destroyed as well (so it may be in the interest of the target's owner to destroy the target themselves if they cannot get it repaired in time, to avoid the parasite infesting further units).

  Warheads that also have [MindControl=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MindControl) set will indeed mind-control the target instead of dealing damage, thus giving the appearance of a hijacker. The target will not take damage from the weapon, nor will it rock or produce sparks. Further more, the parasite can never be evicted (not even by Sonic weapons, Repair Depots or Repair IFVs). As a result of this, the parasite will not be recoverable - the parasite will always be destroyed along with the target.
  As the target is mind-controlled it cannot be re-mind-controlled by another unit (parasite or otherwise), except for permanent mind-control using the Psychic Dominator.

  Note that Parasite=yess warheads will cause an Internal Error when detonated if any of the following conditions are true:

  - Firing weapon is a [ShrapnelWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShrapnelWeapon) or [DeathWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeathWeapon) or [AirburstWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirburstWeapon).
  - Firing weapon is an urban combat weapon (fired from an occupied building).
  - Firing weapon is a secondary weapon. (The problem was resolved by adding Parasite=yes to the warhead of [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) and [ElitePrimary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ElitePrimary).)

  ## Note

  - Hardcoded to always use [AG=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AG).
  - Hardcoded to kill [InfantryTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) instantly.
  - Hardcoded to not attack [BuildingTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) even though it can be set to attack.
  - When a unit uses parasitic weapons with both [Naval=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Naval) and [Organic=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Organic) settings, it will use hardcoded squid parasitism.
  - If [TechnoTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoTypes) has [Parasiteable=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Parasiteable), the units that use parasitic weapons as their primary weapons will not be able to select them as attack targets. This will not result in automatic switching of Secondary.
  - When the parasitic unit is destroyed, parasites that were not destroyed by [SuppressionThreshold](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SuppressionThreshold) will immediately be generated on the dead cell.
  - The damage of parasitic weapons will still be calculated normally based on [Verses](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses) and other settings. If the warhead is set with special settings such as [Radiation](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Radiation), the damage can still be immunized by units with corresponding immune flags. Of course, doing so will not prevent parasites from launching parasitic attacks, it will only prevent parasitic damage from occurring.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  - If a friendly unit is mind-controlled (e.g. Yuri Clone) and then you infest it with a parasite (e.g. Terror Drone), but then kill the enemy that is mind-controlling your unit, your unit will revert back to your ownership but the parasite will remain inside and continue to damage it.
  - If a parasite destroys an airborne unit then the parasite will appear, unscathed, on the ground beneath the destroyed airborne unit.
  - There is a graphical glitch with mind-controller parasites, in that the mind-control link is drawn between the target and the position the parasite was at just before it entered the unit. This can be overcome in [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares) by using MindControl.Permanent=yes. When the parasitized unit dies, the line will be removed. However, parasites do not actually die or reappear, However, the parasite will not actually die or reappear, it will continue to be stored in game memory, and [BuildLimit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildLimit) will still consider it to exist.
  - A parasite with Naval=yes cannot attack targets that are not located on [Water](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Water) cell.
  - The reappearance of parasites after killing units is not limited by [SpeedType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpeedType), only by Naval. The Naval=yes will determine parasites can appear on the corresponding Water cells. For example, the original Terror Drone cannot exist on water, but if Naval=yes is added to it, it will be able to stay on water after killing units on water, rather than disappearing directly, although it still cannot move on water.
  - Squid parasitism will be immediately cleared when the parasitic target is on a Non-Water cell. Parasites will reappear in nearby suitable cells, but there is a high probability that they cannot appear due to factors such as terrain and unit obstruction.

  If Temporal=yes is set on a weapon's [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead), then the target will be "frozen" and gradually erased from time. The affected unit is rendered transparent, and the animation specified by [[AudioVisual](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AudioVisual)]→[ChronoSparkle1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ChronoSparkle1) is played over it. Whilst a unit is frozen it cannot be targeted or affected by any other [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead) (except other Temporal=yes [warheads](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warheads)), and is unable to move or attack.

  The firing unit must continue firing the weapon at the target until the target is erased, otherwise the target will unfreeze unharmed. The delay necessary to erase an object depends on the weapon's [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) - each frame, a Temporal weapon firing at a target "takes away" as many points as its Damage dictates, and the unit gets erased when 10 * its maximum hitpoints have been "taken away". The duration completely ignores warhead percentages or current unit hitpoints.

  Objects that have [Warpable=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warpable) set cannot be targeted (and thus cannot be affected) by a Temporal=yes [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead).

  Note that Temporal=yes warheads will cause an [Internal Error](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error) when detonated if any of the following conditions are true:

  - Firing weapon is a shrapnel weapon and [DeathWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeathWeapon).
  - Firing weapon is an urban combat weapon (fired from an occupied building).
  - Warhead has a non-zero [CellSpread](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/CellSpread) set.
  - Warhead also uses the [Culling=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Culling) flag (which doesn't apply to non-squidlike units anyway).
  - Firing weapon is a secondary weapon (except for Infantry with [Deployer=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Deployer) and [DeployFire=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DeployFire)). ;(The problem was resolved by adding Temporal=yes to the warhead of [Primary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary) and [ElitePrimary](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ElitePrimary))

  However, certain locomotors have odd behavior when applied in this manner. It is unknown whether that is a bug or Westwood's intended way of working, since they only utilized the jumpjet locomotor in the game.

  LocomotorEffectTeleportAfter attacking the unit, the weapon won't retarget until manually ordered or the targeted unit is destroyed.
  Also, the victim will be frozen stiff after being moved, and will become easy prey for anything.FlyThe target will be 'stunned', and will ignore commands given to it.
  But it won't move anywhere. AddLandable=yesto the target unit, to stop it from doing so. (Discovered by CKW)WalkThe target will move using it's default locomotor and then freeze as with the Teleport locomotor.DriveShipTunnelThe target will stop, and move orders will be frequently interupted while the weapon is affecting the target. (Possibly related to the ROF)RocketHoverDropPodThe target will move to the firer place like a meteor, It can even hurt the firer. However, the affected units will always occupy the space where they are attacked. For Vehicle, you can use ChronoSphereSpecial to "kill" it by one unit to make the cell normal, but for Aircraft, you will get an IE!

  ## Notes

  When `[TechnoTypes]`→[Size=int](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Size) ≥ `[Weapons]`→[Damage=int](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage), the weapon can still be fired, but it will not have any effect.

  This weapon can only be fired once in reality, therefore the operations of creating entities such as debris through the warhead are only executed once during the initial firing.

  Techno already in the inair[1] state is not affected by this.

  If the primary weapon uses the IsLocomotor=yes warhead, when aiming at a building [2], it will switch to other weapons that can fire at the target (if any), even if other settings like `[Warhead]`→[Verses=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses) do not prohibit this weapon from firing at buildings.

  If the secondary weapon uses the IsLocomotor=yes warhead, then attacking a vehicle inside a Tank Bunker cannot lift it out, and the attack continues but has no effect.

  - If at this point the bunker building is sold, causing the target vehicle to no longer be protected by the bunker, then it will not refresh its state correctly. Instead, due to its occupied space not correctly returning to the map, it will remain in a state where it can be targeted and attacked but will never be destroyed and does not occupy space.
  - Starting from [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#49, warheads with IsLocomotor=yes can no longer fire at vehicles in Tank Bunkers.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  IsLocomotor=yes will prevent the [ShrapnelWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShrapnelWeapon) from being created for this weapon, but it is normal for the [AirburstWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirburstWeapon).

  If the warhead of a weapon has IsLocomotor=yes, then the weapon cannot be used as a DeathWeapon.

  The natural landing position of the affected unit is controlled by its own pathfinding rules. This means that if the target is a unit that can originally move to the firer's cell, such as the original `[ZEP]`, it will be attracted directly above the firer, then fall vertically to crush the firer while being destroyed itself.

  [Harvester](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Harvester) dont stop unloading and cannot unload cargos anymore when lifting by IsLocomotor=yes warhead.

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#47.

  When a vehicle has [hover](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Locomotor#Hover) locomotor and is being lifted by IsLocomotor=yes warhead there has some wrong shadow.

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#47.

  Locomotor warhead won't stop working when firer (except for vehicle) stop firing.

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#48.

  Locomotor warhead won’t stop working when the attacker is being affected by [Temporal=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Temporal) warhead.

  IsLocomotor=yes warhead rendering hover units unselectable and undamageable on elevated bridge.

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#48.

  Since weapon selection lacks the check for secondary weapon using IsLocomotor=yes warhead and, according to other rules, it is determined that primary weapon cannot be used, the secondary weapon will always shoot at the target vehicle regardless of whether it is in a building with Bunker=yes.

  - This bug has been fixed in Phobos Build#49.

  Define whether this is a warhead that calls in an airstrike.

  ## Notes

  Airstrike=yes will prevent the [ShrapnelWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ShrapnelWeapon) from being created for this weapon, but it is normal for the [AirburstWeapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirburstWeapon).

  This type of warheads does not deal damage nor establish an aggro link. Setting the [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) on weapons that use it to a non-zero value can normally create animations in the [AnimList=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AnimList), but it will not make other effects take effect, even if it is [Rocker=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Rocker), which does not require actual lethality.

  [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Warning_small.png) If this effect is activated, then set [AirstrikeTeam=1](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirstrikeTeam) (or higher) on guide unit is also required. Otherwise, the effect will not be truly activated, and the laser guide line and tinting will not be drawn. Additionally, [AirstrikeTeamType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirstrikeTeamType) must be set to a valid [AircraftType](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftType); otherwise, firing will immediately trigger [EIP#0041D88D](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_0041D88D).

  - Whether AirstrikeTeam=1 (or higher) is satisfied directly determines whether the Airstrike logic can be truly activated.
  If it is not satisfied, then even if EliteAirstrikeTeam meets the conditions, nothing related will be enabled.
  If it is satisfied, then even ifEliteAirstrikeTeam is not satisfied, it can normally draw the flare line and tint the target, only it will not summon any[1] aircraft.
    - If it is not satisfied, then even if EliteAirstrikeTeam meets the conditions, nothing related will be enabled.
    - If it is satisfied, then even ifEliteAirstrikeTeam is not satisfied, it can normally draw the flare line and tint the target, only it will not summon any[1] aircraft.

  This uses [AirstrikeRechargeTime](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirstrikeRechargeTime) as the cooldown time for aircraft after returning from executing an airstrike, similar to [SpawnRegenRate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SpawnRegenRate) in the [spawns](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Spawns#On_TechnoType) system.

  The corresponding flags for when the guide unit reaches Elite level are as follows:

  [SOMETECHNO]EliteAirstrikeTeam=EliteAirstrikeTeamType=EliteAirstrikeRechargeTime=
  Note that the three flags in the Elite version have a Resetting Bug, if the data of the guide unit is changed in the map, then these three flags must be redefined.

  When the aircraft enters the map, it will play the voice specified by `[AudioVisual]`→[AirstrikeAttackVoice=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirstrikeAttackVoice). If after that, before the strike is completed, the unit responsible for guiding dies, then it will play the voice specified by `[AudioVisual]`→[AirstrikeAbortSound=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirstrikeAbortSound) and directly enter the return process.

  Just like spawnee, the experience gained by airstrike aircraft after destroying targets is their own and is not transferred to the guide units. Ares changed this. See #References.

  Weapons using this type of warhead will tint the locked target with a color defined in `[ColorAdd]`, specified by `[AudioVisual]`→[LaserTargetColor=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/LaserTargetColor) to indicate its index in that list. At the same time, draw a red line between the [FLH](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/FLH) and the target, with brightness continuously changing between `190,0,0` and `255,0,0`. The end of this line[2] is located on the target, and draw a slightly larger red point. The position of the point will randomly move in `±15` radius based on the result range of a random number generator, while also affecting the position of the line's drawing end. Additionally, you can simultaneously enable a special Airstrike-style[3] attack cursor on weapons using this warhead by setting [MigAttackCursor=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MigAttackCursor), replacing the normally used `Attack` cursor.

  When weapons with this warhead are used as a [secondary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Secondary) for any technos[4], they will be prioritized for use when attacking buildings and can only be used for attacking buildings. This will also introduce a rule for weapon selection:

  ((ResourceGatherer&&ResourceDestination) || !CanC4) = true
  When this condition is satisfied, even if other conditions permit, the target buildings cannot be attacked by this weapon, and it will fall back to using the [primary weapon](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Primary). A specific example is in [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge), when Boris attacks a Barrel, V3 Ammunition, Ammo Crate or deployed Slave Miner, he uses the AKM instead of calling an airstrike.

  If, after the above formula determines to use the secondary weapon and not fall back to the primary weapon, the secondary weapon is unable to attack the target buildings due to reasons such as [Verses=0%](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Verses), then the infantry will be unable to obtain the `Attack` cursor on the target buildings.

  The rule mentioned above is still part of the conventional weapon selection rules, so it can still be forcibly overridden by mandatory selections such as [OpenTransportWeapon=0](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/OpenTransportWeapon)[5]. However, in this case, it will ignore MigAttackCursor=yes and use the regular `Attack` cursor instead of the `Airstrike` cursor.

  If an aircraft has AirstrikeTeam=1[6], then whenever it is on an [Attack mission](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Mission_Control) and receives a Stop order, it may fly to the map boundary and be removed from the game upon arrival. If the aircraft also has [AirportBound=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AirportBound) and [Ammo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ammo) is set to a value not equal to `-1`[7], then this behavior will inevitably be triggered.

  If `[General]`→[SovParaDropInf=](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/SovParaDropInf) is not defined or invalid, then weapons using this warhead will also trigger [EIP#0041D88D](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Internal_Error#eip_0041D88D) once they start firing.

  Airstrike flare line drawn to target at lower elevation would clip.

  - This bug has been fixed in [Phobos](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Phobos) Build#47.

  In fact, although airstrike passes an object to flare line, it passes the position parameter of the target's cell to the aircraft. Therefore, when the target is a moving object, it always performs unsatisfactorily, after all, it cannot track the target to launch an attack.

  - See #References.

Even if the target should be immune according to the above formula, or as the attacker's infantry, due to settings like [Deployer](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Deployer) and [UndeployDelay](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UndeployDelay), it is actually impossible to switch to the deployed state to fire the secondary weapon at the target.

  This is only for warheads with [Parasite=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Parasite), used to prevent the target unit from moving (does not affect firing) for the specified number of frames after impact. In [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2), this is used by the Giant Squid to simulate the effect of ships being entangled by tentacles and thus unable to continue sailing.

  DeeZire once used this logic to create an EMP Tank in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2).

  ## Notes

  This only affects movement; it does not prevent the unit from rotating its Turret and firing.

  Since it must be used together with [Parasite=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Parasite), it can only be effective on a single target.

After being launched from the [NukeSilo](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/NukeSilo) building `[NAMISL]`, it vertically ascends to the height set by the [DetonationAltitude](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/DetonationAltitude) of its projectile `[GiantNukeUp]`, then detonates and creates a vertically descending nuclear missile `[NukePayload]` in the cell where the superweapon was released, to actually inflict damage.

  ## Notes

  When a weapon using this warhead detonates, it causes a fixed-named weapon `[NukePayload]` to begin falling from the DetonationAltitude height of the original weapon's projectile above the target cell.

  - If the projectile of `[NukePayload]` has [Vertical=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Vertical), and the original weapon's DetonationAltitude is greater than the DetonationAltitude of `[NukePayload]`'s projectile, this will cause `[NukePayload]` to detonate immediately after being created.

  ## Special Values

  In RA/TS
  heavy=0% (Infantry Only)
  [Infantry](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InfantryTypes) using a weapon that deals 0% damage to `heavy` armor will not passively acquire nor retaliate against any [vehicle](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes), [aircraft](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AircraftTypes), or [building](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BuildingTypes) targets. This ensures units like snipers or attack dogs won't acquire targets that they're not able to harm.

  For example:

  [HollowPoint]
  Verses=100%,1%,1%,0%,1%
  As mentioned, this special logic only works on infantry units wielding the weapon.

  In RA2/YR
  There are special-case `Verses` values that are only available in [Red Alert 2](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Red_Alert_2) and [Yuri's Revenge](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Yuri%27s_Revenge). These values are 0% and 1%.

  Note: The rules(md).ini comments regarding these values are incorrect. Use this guide to determine the correct effects.

  0% - Forbidden Armor Type
  A `Verses` value of 0% indicates that the corresponding `Armor` type is a forbidden target for this Warhead. A [unit](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Unit) using a weapon with the attached Warhead will not accept an attack command against another unit with that `Armor` type. Nor will it accept a [force fire](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=Force_fire&action=edit&redlink=1) command, [retaliate](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Retaliate), or [passive acquire](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/index.php?title=Passive_acquire&action=edit&redlink=1) on a target with that `Armor` type.

  1% - Cannot Passive Acquire
  A `Verses` value of 1% indicates that a unit using a weapon with the attached Warhead will not passive acquire a target with the corresponding Armor type. However, the unit will still accept an attack command, a force fire command, and retaliate against it. Since 1% renders a great reduction in damage, it is typically only used for special-case weapons that aren't meant to deal damage, such as the Spy's disguise weapon.

  What About 2%?
  2% doesn't seem to have any effect on targeting.

  ## Negative Percentages

  If a verses contains a negative value such as -100% the effects of damage are reversed thus restoring lost Strength=.

  One shot of weapon will deal:

  - 100 * -30% = will restore 30 points of Strength= to Target.

  This flag will be reset to the default value (i.e., all use 100%) after being modified through methods such as the map's built-in INI or other means.

  - Starting from Ares 0.1, although it still affects whether it can aim at the target, it still uses the original value when causing damage;
  - Starting from Ares 0.2, it no longer affects target selection either.

[WeaponType]
AmbientDamage="""
  This flag defines the amount of damage which is inflicted along the trajectory of the weapon. It is not completely ignorant of armor classes and other properties that can change the amount of damage. In other words, it will obey all damage parameters to determine the damage on the target. However, it is not immune to friendly fire and is ignorant of ownership and does not affect the terrain in any way.

  ## Notes

  Ambient damage uses the same [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead) as the weapon to inflict damage.

  Ambient damage can damage objects with [Foundation=0x0](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Foundation#0x0) or [InvisibleInGame=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/InvisibleInGame).

  This flag is still parsed but it will only work under certain types of weapon. One type of weapon that can be applied are sonic weapons such as a dolphin's sonic waves; having IsSonic enabled and this with a valid amount on the weapon. Another type that can be applied are railgun weapons; as long as the weapon has a valid railgun particle system attached and this with a valid amount.

  ## With [Ares](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Ares)

  Ares changes this flag, by allowing all 'waves' to work with this flag, instead of just sonic waves. These waves are defined by the existence of IsSonic=yes, IsMagBeam=yes, Wave.IsLaser=yes, or Wave.IsBigLaser=yes.

In YR, [IsMagBeam=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsMagBeam) provides a similar effect, but it is drawn in the reverse direction (from the target towards the firing unit) when attacking [VehicleTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/VehicleTypes).

  ## Damage calculation

  As noted by some community members in the past, IsSonic deals more damage to closer units than to units that are further away. The reason for this lies (logically), in the way IsSonic works and applies its damage: A sonic wave exists for precisely 20 frames, regardless of how far it has to travel. On each of these frames, it will damage all targets it has passed up to that frame. This, in turn, means a target that is closer to the shooter, and is hit early in the life cycle of the wave, takes considerably more damage, simply because it is longer under the influence of the wave, and damage is applied to it more often.

  Example
  Let us assume there are three targets to be hit by a sonic wave.
  One will be reached after 5 frames, one after 10, and one after 15 frames.
  The table below illustrates how damage would be applied to them, and makes very obvious why closer targets take so much more damage than those further away:

  FrameTarget 1Target 2Target 31no damageno damageno damage2no damageno damageno damage3no damageno damageno damage4no damageno damageno damage5no damageno damageno damage6damageno damageno damage7damageno damageno damage8damageno damageno damage9damageno damageno damage10damageno damageno damage11damagedamageno damage12damagedamageno damage13damagedamageno damage14damagedamageno damage15damagedamageno damage16damagedamagedamage17damagedamagedamage18damagedamagedamage19damagedamagedamage20damagedamagedamage

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  The sonic wave created by IsSonic uses its own hard-coded trackable trajectory, regardless of how the bullet set by the projectile flies. And the sonic wave itself ignores many settings such as [Level](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Level). For example, when the [ApplyDamage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/ApplyDamage) introduced by Ares is enabled and an attack is launched from water to a point on land, it will be observed that the warhead detonates at the shore, but the sonic wave will still fly normally to the target and damage everything along its path.

  Warhead and [AmbientDamage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AmbientDamage) of Sonic weapons always read only the Primary weapon.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.1.

  Weapons with either IsSonic=yes[1] do not deliver conventional damage and rely on other means like ambient damage.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.8.[2]

  Sonic weapons don't normally fire at targets over 8 spaces.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.B.

  [Hardcoded]: IsSonic does not read [Wall=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Wall) on warhead.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 3.0.

  ## Notes

  If the projectile is invisible, then the warhead will detonate when the wave hits the target. If it is visible, this wave will be only a graphic effect, and the warhead will detonate when the visible projectile hits. However, AI units will "sense" the wave and try to scatter before the projectile hits.

  Usually IsSonic=yes will cause damage to [TechnoTypes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/TechnoTypes) that also belongs to you. To prevent this, add the [AffectsAllies=no](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AffectsAllies) flag to the Sonic weapon warhead.

  ## Notes

  Actually, it's not just a unit change; when set to `yes`, the calculation of whether the range is satisfied will use the distance between the centers of the cells where both parties are located, rather than the precise distance between the two entities. In vanilla, it is often used for close-range weapons to ensure they have a tolerance distance that allows firing.

  Because theRangeis only1.5, using precise distance calculation, and due to differentsub cells, the GGI's range is insufficient, so it paces back and forth to attack the target.UnderCellRangefinding=yes, the distance calculation method allows the GGI to shoot normally even when theRangeis only1.5and the actual distance is farther due to sub cells.
  An additional effect is that firer[1] units that are above ground but not above[2] the airspace judgment threshold will also ignore their own height, because under this algorithm, the firer's coordinates will be calculated based on the cell center coordinates.

InfiniteMindControl="""
  In Yuri's Revenge, on weapons which use a [warhead](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Warhead) that has has [MindControl=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/MindControl) set, the [Damage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Damage) value determines the number of victims that can be controlled simultaneously by a unit that has said weapon. If this number of victims are controlled, and the controller attempts to control additional targets, an already-controlled unit must be released from control to "make room" for the new victim. Otherwise, no new targets can be acquired (even with other weapons that may not be mind-controlling ones (but see Notes).

  If InfiniteMindControl is set on a weapon which uses a warhead that has MindControl=yes set, the game will skip checking the weapon's Damage when determining the amount of victims a controller can simultaneously control. Instead, it will look up OverloadCount= (List of integer).

  - The OverloadCount list consists of a series of numbers. The game will check the current amount of Mind-Control links of the unit against these numbers. The controller will be classed into the "category" of highest number on the list that the amount is less than, or equal to. These categories are numbered, and once a unit's category has been determined, for example, having equal or less links than the 3rd number in the list would make a unit fall under "category 3", the game will then look up the OverloadDamage and OverloadFrames lists and deal the 3rd number in the OverloadDamage list to the unit, with a delay between each processing that is determined by the 3rd number in the OverloadFrames list.

  In short, the controlling unit will take gradual damage while the number of targets it controls exceeds the first number in the OverloadCount list and damage is increased for each successive category of MC link numbers that the unit advances by controlling additional victims.

DrainWeapon="""
  Specifies whether or not this weapon should "drain" a target it is attacking, rather than dealing damage to it. This weapon will only fire against objects with [Drainable=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Drainable) set and its effect depends on several attributes of the targeted structure:

  - If the target structure is drainable, but has neither a [Storage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Storage) value nor a positive [Power](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Power) value, it will simply be disabled by the attack, as if in a low-power situation.
  - If the target structure is drainable and has a Storage value, the attack will drain money from the building's owner.
  - If the target structure is drainable and has a positive Power value, the entire power of the building's owner will be shut down while the weapon is firing on the structure.

  Using DrainWeapon enforces several special cases upon the weapon:

  - Such weapons do not actually fire their projectile or warhead, using it only for targeting purposes.
  - Such weapons are hardcoded to play the "DISKRAY" animation when firing.
  - The engine expects them to be fired vertically downwards from above a building (as when fired by the Floating Disk) and they will hence fail to fire when fired from any other position, or stop firing if the firing unit moves away from a position right above the structure, even if firing was still permitted by their [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range). Aircraft cannot fire them either. In essence, this means that you are limited to [BalloonHovering](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/BalloonHover) [JumpJet](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/JumpJet) units to fire such weapons.

For example, a Burst=2 weapon fired from a unit with [PrimaryFireFLH=100,50,20](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/PrimaryFireFLH) would fire two shots without stopping, and the first shot would come from `100,50,20` and the second one - from `100,-50,20`.

  ## Notes

  If the projectile is invisible, then the warhead will detonate when the wave hits the target. If it is visible, this wave will be only a graphic effect, and the warhead will detonate when the visible projectile hits. However, AI units will "sense" the wave and try to scatter before the projectile hits.

  ## [](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/File:Cc_alert.png) Bugs/Side-Effects/Unexpected Limitations

  If the target moves out of Weapon's [Range](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/Range), the MagBeam will still be drawn and [AmbientDamage](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/AmbientDamage) will still work.

  - This bug has been fixed in Ares 0.B.
"""
AttachedParticleSystem="""
  Defines a `[ParticleSystem]` to be used as the weapon's firing effect. This flag requires the presence of either [UseFireParticles=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UseFireParticles), [UseSparkParticles=yes](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/UseSparkParticles), or [IsRailgun=true](https://modenc.renegadeprojects.com/IsRailgun), though any type of particle system can be specified regardless of which trigger flag is used.
